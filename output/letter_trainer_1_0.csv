It opened in London in 1985, and is the longest running musical in the history of London's West End. My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The theater seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is very high over the stage. One of the big events in the story is the building of a street barricade, over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even having a cigarette. On cue they would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

CS_,"CSI.    	The TV show ""CSI"" gets a lot of criticism from law enforcement agencies for its unrealistic portrayal of the procedures and science of criminal investigation. I don't care though, as I just think it's a fun show to watch.

My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The old theater's seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the storyline is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even smoking cigarettes. On cue, the stagehands would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the musical version of the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

_SN,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although to me, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" these days. The numbering system was introduced in 1936. Before 1986, a SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax forms who did not actually exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the age of 5 years.

It has been ranked as the second best spy novel of all time, just behind the even more enjoyable ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" by John le Carre. I'll agree with that sentiment. Ludlum wrote two sequels, and all three parts of the Bourne Trilogy have been made into very successful movies now, starring Matt Damon in the title role. Ludlum died before he could write more than three novels featuring Jason Bourne, but five more titles in the series have been published, written by Eric Van Lustbader. I must check them out ..."

Anne Frank was a German until she lost her nationality in 1941 when the Nazis came to power. By this time she was living with her family in Amsterdam, as the Franks chose to flee Germany in 1933. When the Germans occupied the Netherlands, the family went into hiding in the attic of Otto Frank's office building (Otto was Anne's father).

E_AU,"ESAU.    	Esau was the twin brother of Jacob, the founder of the Israelites. When their mother Rebekah gave birth to the twins ""the first emerged red and hairy all over (Esau), with his heel grasped by the hand of the second to come out (Jacob)"". As Esau was the first born, he was entitled to inherit his father's wealth (it was his ""birthright""). Instead, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for the price of a ""mess of pottage"" (a meal of lentils)."
NER_,"NERO.    	The Great Fire of Rome raged for five and a half days in 64 AD. Of the fourteen districts of Rome, three were completely destroyed, and seven more suffered serious damage. The emperor at the time was of course Nero, although reports that he fiddled, played his lyre or sang while the city burned; those accounts are probably not true. In fact, Nero was staying outside of Rome when the fire started, and rushed home on hearing the news. He organized a massive relief effort, throwing open his own home to give shelter to many of the citizens who were left living on the street."

U_A,"UMA.    	'Gattaca' is a science fiction movie starring Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman that was released in 1997. Set in the not-too-distant future, the film describes a society in which potential children are preselected so that they inherit the most desirable traits from their parents.

The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
IA_,"IAN.    	Ian Fleming is most famous of course for writing the ""James Bond"" series of spy novels. You might also know that he wrote the children's story ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", which was made into a cute movie released in 1968 and even a stage musical that opened in 2002."

_TIS,"OTIS.    	Otis Campbell is the town drunk on the sitcom 'The Andy Griffith Show', and was played by actor Hal Smith. The Campbell character was dropped in the late sixties as sponsors became concerned about being associated with heavy drinking."

They were written by a number of ghost writers, but the character was introduced by Edward Stratemeyer in 1930. Nancy Drew's boyfriend was Ned Nickerson, a college student from Emerson."
OTI_,"OTIS.    	Elevators (simple hoists) have been around for a long time. What Elisha Otis did was come up with the ""safety elevator"", a design that he showcased at the 1853 World's Fair in New York. At the Fair, Otis would stand on an elevated platform in front of onlookers and order his assistant to cut the single rope holding up the platform. His safety system kicked in when the platform had only fallen a few inches, amazing the crowd. After this demonstration, the orders came rolling in."
AN_E,"ANNE.    	Anne, Princess Royal was born in 1950 and is the only daughter of British Queen Elizabeth II. Princess Anne has been in the public spotlight for many things, including her success as an equestrian.

Zara's medal was presented to her by her own mother, Princess Anne."

_MA,"UMA.    	Robert Thurman was the first westerner to be ordained a Tibetan Buddhist monk. Robert raised his children in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and called his daughter ""Uma"" as it is a phonetic spelling of the Buddhist name ""Dbuma"". Uma's big break in movies came with her starring role in Quentin Tarantino's 1994 hit 'Pulp Fiction'. My favorite Uma Thurman film is the wonderful 1996 romantic comedy 'The Truth About Cats and Dogs'."
_AO,"TAO.    	The Chinese character ""tao"" translates as ""path"", but the concept of Tao signifies the true nature of the world."
EL_,"ELK.    	The elk (also known as wapiti) is the one of the largest species of deer in the world, with only the moose being bigger. Early European settlers were used to seeing the smaller red deer back in their homelands, so when they saw the ""huge"" wapiti they assumed it was a moose, and gave it the European name for a moose, namely ""elk"". The more correct term then is ""wapiti"", the Shawnee name for the animal, which means ""white rump"". Very confusing ..."
_RCA,"ORCA.    	The taxonomic name for the killer whale is Orcinus orca. The use of the name ""orca"", rather than ""killer whale"", is becoming more and more common. The Latin word ""Orcinus"" means ""belonging to Orcus"", with Orcus being the name for the Kingdom of the Dead."

SS_,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the age of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

_BI,"OBI.    	Puccini's ""Madama Butterfly"" is the most-performed opera in the US. The opera that we see today is actually the second version that Puccini produced. The original version was first staged in 1904 at La Scala in Milan where it received a very poor reception. Puccini reworked the piece, breaking the second act into two new acts and making some other significant changes. The opera was relaunched a few months later and it was a resounding success."

N_RO,"NERO.    	""I, Claudius"" is a 1934 novel penned by Robert Graves, written in the form of an autobiography of Emperor Claudius of Rome.

_NNE,"ANNE.    	Anne Frank has to be one of the most famous victims of the Holocaust. This is largely because the story of this young girl lives on in her widely published diary, and in adaptations of the diary for stage and screen. Anne Frank was a German until she lost her nationality in 1941 when the Nazis came to power. By this time, she was living with her family in Amsterdam, as the Franks chose to flee Germany in 1933. When the Germans occupied the Netherlands, the family went into hiding in the attic of Otto Frank's office building (Otto was Anne's father). There the family hid for two whole years, until they were betrayed. The family was split up, and Anne and her sister died from typhus in a concentration camp in 1945."

The current lion is called Leo, and he has been around since 1957."

The Gabor sisters were born in Budapest and immigrated to the United States separately, with Eva being the first to arrive. Eva broke into movies, but her most famous role was on the TV sitcom ""Green Acres"" in which she played the lovely character Lisa Douglas opposite Eddie Albert. One of Eva's claims to fame is the unwitting promotion of the game called ""Twister"", the sales of which were languishing in 1996. In an appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" she got on all fours and played the game with Johnny Carson. Sales took off immediately, and Twister became a huge hit."

C_I,"CSI.    	The TV show ""CSI"" gets a lot of criticism from law enforcement agencies for its unrealistic portrayal of the procedures and science of criminal investigation. I don't care though, as I just think it's a fun show to watch. The original ""CSI"" set in Las Vegas seems to have ""gone off the boil"" lately, but the addition of Sela Ward to the cast of ""CSI: NY"" has really, really raised the level of the sister show set in New York City."

What we call eastern Canada is a French-speaking province called ""Canady"", and western Canada is a Russian-speaking province ""Estody"".

It is now the longest running musical in the history of London's West End, and is playing at the Queen's Theater. I saw Les Miz in the Queen's Theater, only able to get tickets in the very back row. The theater seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is very high over the stage. One of the big events in the show is the building of a street barricade, and the fighting over it. At that height we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even having a cigarette. On cue they would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy it that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the story didn't grab me as it is portrayed in the musical."

_RIC,"ERIC.    	""Layla"" is one of the great rock anthems of the seventies, released by Derek and the Dominos in December of 1970. It is a masterpiece of composition, with the first half of the song a great vehicle for the guitar-playing talents of Eric Clapton.

However, that's not the case. The application was filed on March 14, 1912 and registration took place on August 12, 1913. So, who knows why it's March 6th?"
SS_,SSR.    	Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR)
I_CA,"INCA.    	The Inca people emerged as a tribe around the 12th century, in what today is southern Peru. The Incas developed a vast empire over the next 300 years, extending along most of the western side of South America. The Empire fell to the Spanish, finally dissolving in 1572 with the execution of Tupac Amaru, the last Incan Emperor."
_ED,NED.    	Actor Ned Beatty is probably best remembered for the rather disturbing 'squeal like a pig' scene in the movie 'Deliverance'. Beatty also earned an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the 1976 movie 'Network'.
_SN,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation although, given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax returns who did not exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in the following year's returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."
C_I,CSI.    	(54. See 40-Down : DNA TESTS)
_OL,"AOL.    	Netscape's flagship product was its browser, which eventually came to be known as Netscape Navigator. Navigator had a huge impact on computing, basically bringing the Net to the masses by offering an intuitive, user-friendly interface. So popular was the product, that when the company had its IPO, the initial stock price set at $14 a share had to be doubled to $28 at the last minute. At the end of the first day's trading, the stock closed at $75, and there were a lot of very rich people as a result (at least on paper!)."
_LO,"ELO.    	The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) is a symphonic rock group from the north of England. The band's manager was Don Arden, father of Sharon Osbourne (wife of Ozzy)."
AN_E,"ANNE.    	What we call ""Queen Anne's Lace"" over here in the US is known by many in the British Isles as the ""wild carrot"". The roots of Queen Anne's Lace are indeed edible, just like carrots, but only when they are very young because later in life they get very woody. The wild carrot was given the name Queen Anne's Lace when it was introduced into America as the flowers do resemble white lace. There is one small red flower in the center of the plant which is said to be a drop of blood that Queen Anne spilled when she pricked herself as she was making the lace."
O_R,"ORR.    	Bobby Orr is regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time. By the time he retired in 1978 he had undergone over a dozen knee surgeries. At 31 years of age, he concluded that he just couldn't skate anymore. Reportedly, he was even having trouble walking ..."
_EO,"LEO.    	Despite rumors to the contrary, I am pretty sure that Barack Hussein Obama II was indeed born in Hawaii. President Obama was born on August 4, 1961 at Kapi'olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii."
R_NE,"RENE.    	'René' and 'Renée' are French for the adjective 'reborn', when applied to masculine and feminine nouns respectively."
ETN_,"ETNA.    	Mt. Etna is the largest of three active volcanoes in Italy. Mt Etna is about 2 1/2 times the height of its equally famous sister, Mt. Vesuvius."
_SI,"CSI.    	The TV show ""CSI"" gets a lot of criticism from law enforcement agencies for its unrealistic portrayal of the procedures and science of criminal investigation. I don't care though, as I just think it's a fun show to watch. The original ""CSI"" set in Las Vegas seems to have ""gone off the boil"" lately, but the addition of Sela Ward to the cast of ""CSI: NY"" has really, really raised the level of the sister show set in New York City."
E_K,"ELK.    	The elk (also known as the wapiti) is the one of the largest species of deer in the world, with only the moose being bigger. Early European settlers were familiar with the smaller red deer back in their homelands, so when they saw the ""huge"" wapiti they assumed it was a moose, and incorrectly gave it the European name for a moose, namely ""elk"". The more correct name for the beast is ""wapiti"", which means ""white rump"" in Shawnee. It's all very confusing ..."
_RCA,"ORCA.    	The taxonomic name for the killer whale is Orcinus orca. The use of the name ""orca"", rather than ""killer whale"", is becoming more and more common. The Latin word ""Orcinus"" means ""belonging to Orcus"", with Orcus being the name for the Kingdom of the Dead."
_DE,"ODE.    	Ben Jonson was a contemporary of William Shakespeare, and just like Shakespeare, Jonson was a dramatist, poet and actor. Jonson's work was very well received from 1605 to 1620, but his reputation began to wane in the 1620s. He wrote a play called ""The New Inn"" which was received so badly, the actors were hissed off the stage. Immediately afterwards, Jonson wrote about the failure in his poem ""Ode to Himself""."
ON_,ONE.    	Three ... two ... one ... liftoff!
_NCA,"INCA.    	Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro discovered the Incas in 1526, the beginning of the end for the ancient civilization, ravaged by force and by imported smallpox."
_RS,"IRS.    	The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) came into being during the Civil War, to raise money to cover war expenses. Prior to the introduction of income tax in 1862, the government was funded by levies on trade and property."
E_K,"ELK.    	Elk Island National Park is located 35 km east of Edmonton, Alberta. The park was established in 1913."
_SI,"CSI.    	The 'CSI' franchise of TV shows has been tremendously successful, but seems to be winding down. 'CSI: Miami' (the 'worst' of the franchise, I think) was cancelled in 2012 after ten seasons. 'CSI: NY' (the 'best' of the franchise) was cancelled in 2013 after nine seasons. The original 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation', set in Las Vegas, is still going strong and has been doing so since 2000."

SS_,"SSR.    	The former Soviet Union (USSR) was created in 1922, not long after the Russian Revolution of 1917 that overthrew the Tsar. Geographically, the new Soviet Union was roughly equivalent to the old Russian Empire, and was comprised of fifteen Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs)."
IA_,"IAN.    	James Bond was of course the creation of the writer Ian Fleming. Fleming 'stole' the James Bond name from an American ornithologist. The number 007 was 'stolen' from the real-life, 16th century English spy called John Dee. Dee would sign his reports to Queen Elizabeth I with a stylized ""007"" to indicate that the reports were for 'her eyes only'."
_IA,CIA.    	The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is the successor to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) formed during WWII. The CIA was chartered by the National Security Act of 1947.
T_D,"TED.    	'Ted' is a movie written, directed, produced and starring Seth MacFarlane. In the story, MacFarlane voices a teddy bear who is the best friend of a character played by Mark Wahlberg."
_SAU,"ESAU.    	Esau was the twin brother of Jacob, the founder of the Israelites. When their mother, Rebekah, gave birth to the twins ""the first emerged red and hairy all over (Esau), with his heel grasped by the hand of the second to come out (Jacob)"". As Esau was the first born, he was entitled to inherit his father's wealth (it was his ""birthright""). Instead, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for the price of a ""mess of pottage"" (a meal of lentils)."
_STI,ASTI.    	Asti is in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy. It is perhaps most famous for its Asti Spumante sparkling white wine. Moscato d'Asti is produced from the same grape (Moscato Bianco) but is a much sweeter wine with a lower alcohol content. It is usually served as a dessert wine.

IA_,"IAN.    	Ian McEwan is an English author with a track record of writing well-received novels. McEwan's most famous work at the moment I would say is ""Atonement"" which has benefited from the success of the fabulous movie adaptation released in 2007."
AD_,"ADA.    	The American Dental Association (ADA) is the largest and oldest national dental association in the world. Today the ADA is based in Chicago, but the association was founded in Niagara Falls, New York in 1859. The ADA started out as a group of 26 dentists and it now has more than 152,000 members."

_ES,"LES.    	""Au revoir, les enfants"" (""Goodbye, Children"") is a French film released in 1987. The film is based on real events from the childhood of director Louis Malle who witnessed a Gestapo raid on his school in which three Jewish students and a Jewish teacher were taken and transported to Auschwitz, where they were gassed upon arrival."
OMA_,"OMAN.    	Oman lies on the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula, neighbored by the OAE, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The capital city of Muscat has a strategic location on the Gulf of Oman, and has a history of invasion and unrest. Centuries of occupation by the Persians ended in 1507 when the Portuguese took the city in a bloody attack. The Portuguese held Muscat for much of the next century until finally ousted by local Omani forces in 1648. A Yemeni tribe invaded the area in 1741 and set up a monarchy that has been in place ever since."
LE_,LEO.    	Leo is the fifth astrological sign of the Zodiac. People born from July 23 to August 22 are Leos.
SO_,"SOS.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
_RIC,"ERIC.    	I used to visit Google a lot when I was in the industry. It is an amazing place, but the culture wouldn't suit an old fogey like me. It is a great company that produces wonderful products though. Eric Schmidt was brought in as CEO in 2001 as the ""grown up"" needed by Google's young co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Not too long ago Google announced that Page and Brin are ""all grown up"" now, and so Schmidt stepped down as CEO in April 2011, with Page taking over the the reins. Schmidt is now Executive Chairman of the company."
OR_O,"OREO.    	How the Oreo cookie came to get its name seems to have been lost in the mists of time. One theory is that it comes from the French 'or' meaning 'gold', a reference to the gold color of the original packing. Another suggestion is that the name is the Greek word 'oreo' meaning 'beautiful, nice, well-done'."
_OL,"AOL.    	Founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1983, the company changed its name in 1989 to America Online. As America Online went international, the acronym AOL was used in order to shake off the ""America-centric"" sound to the name. During the heady days of AOL's success the company could not keep up with the growing number of subscribers, so people trying to connect often encountered busy signals. That's when users referred to AOL as ""Always Off-Line""."

OR_A,"ORCA.    	The orca that starred in the 1993 movie ""Free Willy"" was actually called Keiko, with Willy being his ""stage name"". Keiko had a sad life. He was captured near Iceland in 1979 and sold to a local aquarium. Subsequently he was sold on to Marineland in Ontario, and then Six Flags Mexico in 1985. After starring in the movie, his fans raised money with the intent of returning Keiko to the wild. Keiko had become very ill, partly from being confined in a small tank in Mexico, so a lot of money had to be spent returning him to good health. He was purchased by the Oregon Coast Aquarium who undertook the task of treating him and preparing him for the wild. You might recall the dramatic journey he took from Mexico to Oregon in US Air Force transport plane in 1996. Having regained his health, he was flown to Iceland and there was gradually reintroduced into the wild. Sadly, Keiko did not fare too well back in the ocean. He was never adopted by a pod, so lived a solitary life. He lost weight, would sometimes follow fishing boats and play with any humans who would give him attention. In 2003 he beached himself in Taken Bay in Norway, where he died."

_MA,"UMA.    	Robert Thurman was the first westerner to be ordained a Tibetan Buddhist monk. Robert raised his children in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and called his daughter ""Uma"" as it is a phonetic spelling of the Buddhist name ""Dbuma"". Uma's big break in movies came with her starring role in Quentin Tarantino's 1994 hit 'Pulp Fiction'. My favorite Uma Thurman film is the wonderful 1996 romantic comedy 'The Truth About Cats and Dogs'."
E_L,"EEL.    	Electrophorus electricus is the biological name for the electric eel. Despite its name, the electric ""eel"" isn't an eel at all, but rather what is called a knifefish, a fish with an elongated body that is related to the catfish. The electric eel has three pairs of organs along its abdomen, each capable of generating an electric discharge. The shock can go as high as 500 volts with 1 ampere of current (that's 500 watts), and that could perhaps kill a human."
