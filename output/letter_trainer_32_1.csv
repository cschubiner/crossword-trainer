In making such a sound, geckos are unique in the world of lizards. More interesting to me than a gecko's chirping is its ability to cling to walls and to other vertical surfaces. Their feet are specially adapted with ""toes"" that make extremely intimate, close contact to a surface. The toes have millions of hairs called setae that enable the clinging. It isn't suction that supports them, but rather van der Waals forces (weak ""gravitational"" attractions). Fascinating stuff ..."

The Maytag repairman in the famous advertising campaign was known as ""Ol' Lonely"", the guy who was never called out because Maytag washers and dryers never broke down. Whirlpool bought Maytag in 2006 and basically shut down all Maytag operations, and now just put the Maytag label on Whirlpool appliances."

The inside of a solid object is then three-dimensional, needing an x-, y- and z-coordinate to specify a point, say within a cube."

DIS_OS,"DISCOS.    	Discotheques first appeared during WWII in Occupied France.

_PT,APT.    	Apartment (apt.)
AL_OF,"ALOOF.    	I suppose one might guess from the 'feel' of the word 'aloof' that is has nautical roots. Originally aloof meant 'to windward' and was the opposite to 'alee'. A helmsman might be instructed to stay aloof, to steer the boat into the weather to keep a distance from a lee-shore. It is from this sense of maintaining a distance that aloof came to mean 'distant' in terms of personality. Interesting, huh ...?"
CON_O,"CONDO.    	The words 'condominium' and 'apartment' tend to describe the one type of residential property, a private living space with facilities shared with others residing in the same building or complex.

IRIS_SEA,"IRISH SEA.    	The Isle of Man is a large island located in the middle of the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. I used to spend a lot of time there in my youth, and a very interesting place it is indeed. The Isle of Man is classed as a British Crown Dependency and isn't part of the United Kingdom at all. It is self-governing and has its own parliament called the Tynwald. The Tynwald was created in AD 979 and is arguably the oldest continuously-running parliament in the world. The inhabitants of the island speak English, although they do have their own language as well called Manx, which is very similar to Irish Gaeilge and Scottish Gaelic. And then there are those Manx cats, the ones without any tails. I've seen lots of them, and can attest that they are indeed found all over the island."

SHEE_,"SHEET.    	A ream is 500 sheets of paper. As there were 24 sheets in a quire, and 20 quires made up a ream, there used to be 480 sheets in a ream. Ever since that standard was changed to 500, a 480-sheet packet of paper has been called a ""short ream""."
ARR_W,"ARROW.    	Achilles is a Greek mythological figure, the main protagonist of Homer's ""Iliad"". Supposedly when Achilles was born his mother attempted to make him immortal by dipping him into the River Styx. As he was held by the heel as he was immersed, this became the only vulnerable point on his body. Years later he was killed when a poisoned arrow struck him in the heel. The arrow was shot by Paris."
F_OR,"FLOR.    	'Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands' is a Brazilian comedy film released in 1976, starring Sonia Braga. The movie was remade in English in 1982 under the title 'Kiss Me Goodbye', and starred Sally Field."
_ABS,"TABS.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious as it involved lots of tapping on the spacebar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to ""jump"" across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key, which could be depressed causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."
P_ANO,"PLANO.    	Plano, Texas is located in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. Settlers chose the name 'Plano' in the 1840s. 'Plano' is Spanish for 'flat', a reference to the terrain in the area."
MATTDA_ON,"MATT DAMON.    	""The Bourne Identity"" is a great spy novel written by Robert Ludlum, first published in 1980. It has been ranked as the second best spy novel of all time, just behind the even more enjoyable ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" by John le Carre. Ludlum wrote two sequels, and all three parts of ""The Bourne Trilogy"" have been made into very successful movies starring Matt Damon in the title role. Ludlum died before he could write more than three novels featuring Jason Bourne, but five more titles in the series have been published, written by Eric Van Lustbader. I must check them out ..."

_LGIN,"ELGIN.    	A frieze is an architectural feature found in many Roman and Greek buildings. Inside a room, frieze is the name given to the upper part of the wall, between the picture rail and the crown molding. Outside of a room, the term frieze is the name given to any extended decoration that is positioned above eye level. Perhaps the most famous frieze comes from the Parthenon in Athens. Over a third of this highly decorated feature was removed from Athens and taken to London in the early 1800s by the Earl of Elgin, where they remain on display in the British Museum. These famous ""Elgin Marbles"" are subject of much controversy as the legality of the removal is in dispute."

THOR_E,"THORPE.    	The sports star Jim Thorpe was quite the all-rounder. He played professional football, baseball, and basketball, and also won Olympic golds in two other all-rounder events, the pentathlon and decathlon (in 1912). However, he lost his medals when it was revealed that he had been paid for playing baseball before the Games, and back then, amateur status was important to the Olympic governing body."
ONEL_VE,"ONE LOVE.    	'One Love' is a classic reggae song from 1977 recorded by Bob Marley and the Wailers. A ska version of 'One Love' had been released by the Wailers as early as 1965, but it is the 1977 release that we all remember, I am sure."
PED_CAB,PEDICAB.    	A pedicab is also known as a cycle rickshaw.
_UMAS,"PUMAS.    	The mountain lion is found in much of the Americas from the Yukon in Canada right down to the southern Andes in South America. Because the mountain lion is found over such a vast area, it has many different names applied by local peoples, such as cougar and puma. In fact, the mountain lion holds the Guinness record for the animal with the most number of different names, with over 40 in English alone."
C_ARINET,"CLARINET.    	Artie Shaw was a composer, bandleader and a jazz clarinetist. Shaw's real name was Arthur Jacob Arshawsky, born in New York City in 1910. One of his many claims to fame is that he (a white bandleader) hired Billie Holiday (a black vocalist) and toured the segregated South in the late thirties. Holiday chose to leave the band though, due to hostility from Southern audiences back then. Artie Shaw was married eight times in all. The list of his wives includes the actresses Lana Turner and Ava Gardner, as well Betty Kern, daughter of songwriter Jerome Kern."
_OE,NOE.    	'Noe' is the French form of the name 'Noah'.

He is often referred to as the founder of scholasticism, a method of learning that reigned in Medieval universities right across Europe for about 400 years."
L_SH,"LUSH.    	""Lush"" is a slang term for a heavy drinker. Back in the 1700s, 'lush' was slang for 'liquor'."
PUMIC_,"PUMICE.    	Pumice is volcanic rock that is formed by lava cooling, but with bubbles in it due to water and carbon dioxide frothing out of the lava as it cools. Because of the frothy structure, pumice is relatively light and is a great thermal insulator. As such, it is used in construction to make insulating breeze blocks. Pumice may also float in water."
KLEEN_X,"KLEENEX.    	Even though Kleenex is sometimes used today as a generic term for a tissue, Kleenex is a brand name owned by Kimberley-Clark. Kleenex facial tissues came about after WW1. The material used in the tissue had been developed as a replacement for cotton that was in high demand as surgical tissue during the war. The material developed was called ""Cellucotton"" and was used in gas mask filters. It was first sold as a facial tissue under the name Kleenex in 1924."

SANTAA_A,"SANTA ANA.    	Santa Ana is the county seat of Orange County, California and takes its name from the Santa Ana River that runs through the city. The Santa Ana winds are the very dry air currents that sweep offshore late in the year in Southern California. Because these air currents are so dry, they are noted for their influence over forest fires in the area, especially in the heat of the fall. The winds arise from a buildup of air pressure in the Great Basin that lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Under the right conditions, that air spills over the peaks of the Sierra Nevada and basically ""falls"" down the side of the Sierra range, heading for the ocean. As the air falls it becomes drier and heats up so that relative humidity can fall to below 10% by the time it hits the coast."
_EROS,"HEROS.    	""Hero"" is another name for a submarine sandwich. The hero originated in New York City in the 1800s among Italian immigrants who wanted an Italian sandwich that reminded them of home. The name ""hero"" was coined in the 1930s, supposedly by a food critic in the ""New York Herald Tribune"" when he wrote that ""one had to be a hero"" to finish the gigantic sandwich. Hero is a prevalent term to this day in New York City, reserved for a submarine sandwich with an Italian flavor."
_ODEM,"MODEM.    	A modem is a device that is used to facilitate the transmission of a digital signal over an analog line. At one end of the line a modem is used to 'modulate' an analog carrier signal to encode the the digital information, and at the other end a modem is used to 'demodulate' the analog carrier signal and so reproduce the original digital information. This modulation-demodulation gives the device its name: a MOdulator-DEModulator, or 'modem'."
VOO_OO,VOODOO.    	Voodoo is a religion that originated in the French slave colony of Saint-Domingue on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
SAMB_,"SAMBA.    	Samba is a Brazilian dance, very much symbolic of the festival known as Carnival. Like so much culture around the world, the Samba has its roots in Africa, as the dance is derived from dances performed by former slaves who migrated into urban Rio de Janeiro in the late 1800s. The exact roots of the name ""samba"" seem to have been lost in the mists of time. However, my favorite explanation is that it comes from an African Kikongo word ""Semba"" which means ""a blow struck with the belly button"". We don't seem to have a need for such a word in English ..."
D_CT,DICT.    	One can find words (wds.) in a dictionary (dict.).
_INATRA,"SINATRA.    	Frank Sinatra was the only child of Italian immigrants living in Hoboken, New Jersey. Like so many of our heroes, Sinatra had a rough upbringing. His mother was arrested several times and convicted of running an illegal abortion business in the family home. Sinatra never finished high school, as he was expelled for rowdy conduct. He was later arrested as a youth on a morals charge for carrying on with a married woman, which was an offence back then. But Sinatra straightened himself out by the time he was twenty and started singing professionally."
_ROBONO,"PRO BONO.    	The Latin term 'pro bono publico' means 'for the public good', and is usually shorted to 'pro bono'. The term applies to professional work that is done for free or at a reduced fee as a service to the public."

SOCH_,"SOCHI.    	Sochi is a city in the west of Russian on the Black Sea coast. It is the largest resort city in the whole country. Sochi is going to be pretty busy in the next few years. It will host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, the Russian Formula 1 Grand Prix from 2014 as well as the 2018 World Cup in soccer."
NO_E,"NOLE.    	Florida State University (FSU) is located in Tallahassee, the state capital of Florida. The school's athletic teams are known as the Seminoles (sometimes 'the 'Noles').

Most of the Seminole now live in Oklahoma, after their forced relocation by the US government in the 1840s."

In 1825 Morse was in Washington working on a commissioned painting when he received a one-line letter by horse messenger telling him that his wife was ill. He left immediately for his home in New Haven, Connecticut but by the time that Morse arrived his wife had already died and had been buried. This single event spurred him to move from painting to the development of a rapid means of long distance communication, leading to the single-wire telegraph and Morse code."
_INIS,"FINIS.    	""Finis"" is 'the end, the finish' imported into English via French, as ""finis"" the French word for ... ""finshed"". Ultimately the term derives from the Latin verb ""finire"" meaning ""to finish, limit"" (also giving us ""finite"")."
HE_,"HEL.    	Hel is a being from Norse Mythology who presides over a realm that is also called Hel. The underworld of Hel receives many of the dead, and the term 'go to Hel' is used in Norse accounts to mean 'to die'."

FIR_A,FIRMA.    	'Terra firma' is the Latin for 'solid ground'.
ESQU_,"-ESQUE.    	Franz Kafka was born in 1883 in Prague, then part of Bohemia and today the capital of the Czech Republic. Kafka is known as one of the greatest novelists who worked in the German language, and even has an adjective named after him. Something that is ""kafkaesque"" is senseless, disorienting and may have menacing complexity. As it was for many great artists, Kafka's fame came after his death when much of his work was published."
ARIA_NE,ARIADNE.    	'Bacchus and Ariadne' is an oil painting by Italian Renaissance painter Titian that can be seen in the National Gallery in London.
_ASPER,"JASPER.    	Jasper Johns is a contemporary artist from Augusta, Georgia. Johns' most famous work is called 'Flag', which he created two years after being discharged from the US Army, in 1954. 'Flag' is a representation of the 'Stars and Stripes' made with paint and a collage of newsprint."

Cluedo was the original name of the game, introduced in 1949 by the famous British board game manufacturer Waddingtons. There are cute differences between the US and UK versions. For example, the man who is murdered is called Dr. Black (Mr. Boddy in the US), one of the suspects is the Reverend Green (Mr. Green in the US), and the suspect weapons include a dagger (a knife in the US), a lead pipe (lead piping in the US) and a spanner (a wrench in the US). I think it's a fabulous game, a must during the holidays ..."
_AS,"JAS.    	James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, was one of the Founding Fathers. Back during the founding of the nation, Madison was principal contributor to the Constitution and so today he is often called the Father of the Constitution. While he was serving in the 1st US Congress, Madison wrote the first ten amendments to the constitution, the Bill of Rights. So, he is also known as the Father of the Bill of Rights. With such a contribution it is perhaps fitting that when President Madison passed away in 1836 at 85 years of age, he was the last of the Founding Fathers to die."
_ECTARE,"HECTARE.    	The hectare is a non-SI unit of area that is mainly used to measure land. One hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters (100 meters x 100 meters), and equivalent to 2.47 acres."

She started off with ""A Is for Alibi"" in 1982 and is working her way through the alphabet, most recently publishing ""U Is for Undertow"" in 2009. What a clever naming system!"

_LDEST,"OLDEST.    	The city of St. Augustine in northeast Florida was founded as San Agustín in 1565 by the Spanish. That makes St. Augustine the oldest continuously occupied, European-established settlement in the whole of the US. The Spanish maritime expedition first sighted land in the area on August 28, 1565. As August 28 was the feast day of Augustine of Hippo, San Agustín was chosen as the name for the new territory."
DENI_O,DE NIRO.    	Robert De Niro is noted for his longtime and highly successful collaboration with the director Martin Scorsese. He is also noted for his commitment as a method actor. Famously he gained a full 60 pounds in order to play Jake Lamotta in the 1980 movie 'Raging Bull'.

SENT_,"SENTA.    	Senta Berger is an actress from Austria, regarded by many as the leading German-speaking actress over the past few decades."
_AMOUR,"LAMOUR.    	1940's ""Road to Singapore"" was the first of the wonderful ""Road"" series of movies starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. The trio had great chemistry on screen but there was a bit of luck involved in bringing the three together. The movie was first offered to Fred MacMurray and Jack Oakie, and then to George Burns and Gracie Allen. Everyone declined the roles, with Gracie Allen even saying that she ""thought the whole thing was silly"". The next tactic was to cast Dorothy Lamour who was riding a wave of popularity, but who could take the male leads? The studio decided to take a chance on pairing Hope and Crosby for the first time, and see how they did together. Arguably, Hope and Crosby became the most popular duo on the big screen in the history of cinema."
_EU,JEU.    	'Jeu' is the French word for 'game'.

GA_L,"GAOL.    	If you didn't know Oscar Wilde was Irish, you will when you see the name he was given at birth: Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde!"
EAGLE_,"EAGLES.    	The use of the word ""eagle"" to signify a 2-under-par score on a hole in golf, simply builds on the established use of ""birdie"" for 1-under-par. An eagle is just a ""bigger"" bird, and 2-under par is ""bigger"" and better than 1-under."
SWAB_,"SWABS.    	I've always been fascinated by the fact that the DNA of living things is so very similar across different species. Human DNA is almost exactly the same for every individual (to the degree of 99.9%). However, those small differences are sufficient to distinguish one individual from another, and to determine whether or not individuals are close family relations."
RA_TAG,"RAGTAG.    	""Ragtag and bobtail"" is a colorful phrase that's used to describe the lowest classes, or the rabble. A ""bobtail"" is a horse that has had its tail cut short, a word that goes back as least as far as Shakespeare as he used it in ""King Lear"". A ""tag"" is a piece of cloth that is torn and hanging, which was readily combined with ""rag"" in the original phrase ""tag, rag and bobtail"". This idiom, perhaps originally quoted from Samuel Pepys in his diary in 1659, referred to the lower classes as ""tag, rag and bobtail, dancing, singing and drinking"". The phrase evolved, giving us our contemporary word ""ragtag"" meaning ragged and unkempt."

FLE_,"FLEA.    	Nipper is the name of the dog that appeared in the RCA logo. Nipper was a real dog, actually from England. His owner, Francis Barraud, made a painting of Nipper listening to a gramophone. Barraud then approached several gramophone manufacturers in the hope they would be interested in using the image for advertising. Nipper's likeness was indeed picked up, and around that time it was Barraud himself who came up with the slogan ""His Master's Voice""."
J_HAD,"JIHAD.    	In the Islamic tradition 'jihad' is a duty, either an inner spiritual struggle to fulfill religious duties or an outward physical struggle to defend the faith. Someone engaged in jihad is called a 'mujahid' with the plural being 'mujahideen'."
ALI_SES,"ALIASES.    	George Eliot was the pen name of English novelist Mary Anne Evans. As one might think, Evans chose a male pen name in order that her work might be best appreciated in the Victorian era. Eliot wrote seven novels including 'Adam Bede' (1859), 'The Mill on the Floss' (1860), 'Silas Marner' (1861) and 'Middlemarch' (1871-72)."
DUN_EE,"DUNDEE.    	The city of Dundee lies on the north bank of the Firth of Tay in Scotland. The origins of the name ""Dundee"" are a little obscure, although the omnipresent ""dùn"" in place names all over Scotland and Ireland is the Celtic word for ""fort""."

Wood worked a lot with the actor Bela Lugosi and when Lugosi passed away, the popularity of Wood's film died off with his star. Tim Burton made a biopic about the life and career of Ed Wood that was released in 1994, a movie that was simply called 'Ed Wood'."
S_AT ,"STAT!.    	The exact etymology of ""stat"", a term meaning ""immediately"" in the medical profession, seems to have been lost in the mists of time. It probably comes from the Latin ""statim"" meaning ""to a standstill, immediately"". A blog reader has helpfully suggested that the term may also come from the world of laboratory analysis, where the acronym STAT stands for ""short turnaround time""."
_TACY,"STACY.    	Stacy Keibler is an actress and model as well as a retired professional wrestler.
