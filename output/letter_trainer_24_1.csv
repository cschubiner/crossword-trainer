ONR_D,"ON RED.    	If you're sitting behind a car that doesn't make a right on red, it may just be a rental car driven by someone from Europe. Speaking as someone who learned to drive over there, I must admit I held up a few people at red lights when I first visited this country. That's because in Europe we aren't allowed to make any move past a red light, unless there is an accompanying green arrow. So, if you're driving overseas, take care ..."

CE_TS,"CERTS.    	Certs were the first breath mints to be marketed nationally in the US, hitting the shelves in 1956.
