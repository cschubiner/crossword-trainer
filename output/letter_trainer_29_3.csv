My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The old theater's seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the storyline is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even smoking cigarettes. On cue, the stagehands would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the musical version of the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

Joe figure, but, more famous than all of them I would say is the 1997 movie ""G.I. Jane"" starring Demi Moore in the title role. I thought that 'G.I. Jane' had some potential, to be honest, but it really did not deliver in the end."

FO_E ,"FORE!.    	No one seems to know for sure where the golfing term ""fore!"" comes from. It has been used at least as far back as 1881, and since then has been called out to warn other golfers that a wayward ball might be heading their way. My favorite possibility for its origin is that it is a contraction of the Gaelic warning cry ""Faugh a Ballagh!"" (clear the way!) which is still called out in the sport of road bowling. Road bowling is an Irish game where players bowl balls along roads between villages, trying to reach the end of the course in as few bowls as possible, just like in golf!"
T_GER,"TIGER.    	The origins of the Detroit Tigers baseball team's nickname seems a little unclear. One story is that it was taken from the Detroit Light Guard military unit who were known as ""The Tigers"".

Sakharov participated in the USSR's program to develop the country's first atomic bomb, and was an even more crucial contributor to the development of the devastating hydrogen bomb.

TU_E,"TUBE.    	The name ""London Underground"" is a little deceptive, as over half of the track system-wide is actually ""over ground"", with the underground sections reserved for the central areas. It is the oldest subway system in the world, opening in 1863. It was also the first system to use electric rolling stock, in 1890. ""The Tube"", as it is known by Londoners, isn't the longest subway system in the world though. That honor belongs to the Shanghai Metro. My favorite part of the Tube is the Tube map! It is a marvel of design ..."

My favorite possibility for its origin is that it is a contraction of the Gaelic warning cry ""Faugh a Ballagh!"" (clear the way!) which is still called out in the sport of road bowling.

E_SEN,"EBSEN.    	The actor Buddy Ebsen is best known for playing Jed Clampett in television's 'The Beverly Hillbillies', as wells the title character on the seventies detective series 'Barnaby Jones'. Ebsen had been cast in the role of the Tin Man in the 1939 movie 'The Wizard of Oz', but he developed an allergy to the aluminium dust that was used in the makeup. He ended up in hospital and had to walk away from the part. Ebsen blamed 'The Wizard of Oz' on persistent problems that he had with his lungs in subsequent years. But Ebsen lived 16 years longer that any of the other major cast members of the film, so maybe he got the last laugh!"
FA_A,"FALA.    	Fala was the famous Scottish Terrier that was ever present at the side of President Franklin D. Roosevelt for many years. The terrier was a Christmas gift to the president from his cousin, who had named the dog Big Boy while she trained him as a puppy. President Roosevelt renamed him after an ancestor of his from Falahill in Scotland, so the dog's full name was Murray the Outlaw of Falahill. Fala lived on for several years after the president's passing. I've had the privilege of visiting the gravesites of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt in Hyde Park, New York, and Fala is buried just a few feet away from his master."
S_RUM,"SCRUM.    	If you've ever seen a rugby match, you'll recognize the ""scrum"", where the players designated as ""forwards"" bind together and push against the forwards on the opposing team. It's a way of restarting the game after various types of stoppages. Scrum is short for ""scrummage"", which in itself is a variation of ""scrimmage"". And ""scrimmage"" has its roots in the word ""skirmish"". If you get the chance, take a look at the Matt Damon-Morgan Freeman movie called ""Invictus"", directed by Clint Eastwood. It's all about rugby in South Africa after Nelson Mandela came to power. A powerful film ..."

(I loved that show!), with Nimoy playing a bad guy and Shatner playing an U.N.C.L.E. recruit."
_EDCROSS,"RED CROSS.    	Back in 1859, a Swiss businessman called Henri Dunant went to meet French emperor Napoleon III, to discuss making it easier to conduct commerce in French-occupied Algeria. The Emperor was billeted at Solferino, where France and Austria were engaged in a major battle. In one day, Dunant witnessed 40,000 soldiers die in battle and countless wounded suffering on the battlefield without any organized medical care.

SE_F,"SELF.    	Narcissus was a proud and vain hunter in Greek mythology. He earned himself a fatal punishment, being made fall in love with his own reflection in a pool.

The driving force behind the organization's creation was President Eisenhower's Secretary of State, John Dulles.

He saw that these men were frequenting taverns and brothels, and wanted to offer a more wholesome alternative."
TI_ER,"TIGER.    	The origins of the Detroit Tigers baseball team's name seems a little unclear. One story is that it was taken from the Detroit Light Guard military unit who were known as ""The Tigers"".

Sure enough, when the Detroit baseball team went into the Majors they were formally given permission to use ""The Tigers"" name by the Detroit Light Guard."

His 1976 novel ""Roots"" is based on Haley's own family history, and he claimed to be a direct descendant of the real life Kunta Kinte, the slave who was kidnapped in the The Gambia in 1767.

NOV_E,"NOVAE.    	A nova is basically a star that suddenly gets much brighter, gradually returning to its original state weeks or even years later. The increased brightness of a nova is due to increased nuclear activity causing the star to pick up extra hydrogen from a neighboring celestial body. A supernova is very different from a nova.

The bright burst of a supernova is very short-lived compared to the sustained brightness of a nova."
BEN_,BENE.    	'Bene' is the Latin word meaning 'well'.
A_AMSALE,"ADAM'S ALE.    	I suppose water was all that Adam had available to him to drink, so that's how the expression 'Adam's ale' arose (I am guessing ... can't find anything definitive anywhere). The phrase 'Adam's Ale' makes a nice juxtaposition with ""the demon drink""!"
HE_TZ,"HERTZ.    	The Hertz car rental company was started in 1918 by Walter L. Jacobs in Chicago. He began with just twelve model T Ford cars available for rent. In 1923, the car rental operation was bought out by John D. Hertz who incorporated it into his truck and coach manufacturing company."

Famously, Russell cut her hair extremely short at the start of the second season, an action that was associated with a significant drop in the show's viewership. Russell had to grow out her hair over the season. I haven't seen ""Felicity"", but I really do enjoy Russell playing one of the leads in the entertaining Cold War drama called ""The Americans"" that is aired by FX."
