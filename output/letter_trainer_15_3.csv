VER_,"VERA.    	Vera Wang's first choice for a career was figure skating, but she failed to make the 1968 US Olympics team. She switched to the world of fashion, and is famous for her designs of wedding dresses ... but also costumes for figure skaters."
_IANO,"PIANO.    	Steinway & Sons is supplier of handmade pianos based in New York City and in Hamburg, Germany. The company was founded in Manhattan in 1853 by German immigrant Henry E. Steinway. One element of Steinway's business model is to offer a 'piano bank' service. Performing artists can 'borrow' a particular piano from the bank for a particular concert or tour. About 400 pianos are in the bank, and are located over the world. The value of the bank's collection of pianos is estimated at over $25 million."
H_T,"HAT.    	A fedora is a lovely hat, I think. It is made of felt, and is similar to a trilby, but has a broader brim. ""Fedora"" was a play written for Sarah Bernhardt and first performed in 1889. Bernhardt had the title role of Princess Fedora, and on stage she wore a hat similar to a modern-day fedora. The play led to the women's fashion accessory, the fedora hat, commonly worn by women into the beginning of the twentieth century. Men then started wearing fedoras, but only when women gave up the fashion ..."
NA_U,"NANU.    	""Mork & Mindy"" was broadcast from 1978 to 1982. We were first introduced to Mork (played by Robin Williams, of course) in a special episode of ""Happy Days"". The particular episode in question has a bizarre storyline culminating in Fonzie and Mork having a thumb-to-finger duel. Eventually Richie wakes up in bed, and alien Mork was just part of a dream! Oh, and ""Nanu Nanu"" means hello back on the planet Ork. ""I am Mork from Ork, Nanu Nanu"". Great stuff ..."
YM_A,"YMCA.    	Seeing as ""YMCA"" was released by the Village People, it has been adopted as an anthem by the gay community. The song was written by Victor Willis, a straight member of the band, and he clarifies that the lyrics are extolling the virtues of the ""YMCA"" as a source of recreation for black, urban youth. I think he might have been winking when he said that."
L_ONE,"LEONE.    	Sergio Leone was an Italian film director, very much associated with the genre known as 'Spaghetti Westerns'. Perhaps most famous of his westerns was the so-called 'Man with No Name' trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood. The three films are:"
GT_S,"GTOS.    	The Pontiac GTO was was produced by GM from 1964 to 1974, and again by a GM subsidiary in Australia from 2004 to 2006. The original GTO's design is credited to Pontiac chief engineer at the time John DeLorean, who later was found the DeLorean Motor Company."
OA_S,"OATS.    	The Quaker Oats Company was founded in 1901 when four oat mills merged, including the Quaker Mill Company of Ravenna, Ohio. Quaker Mill's owner Henry Parsons Crowell played the key role in the new company and remained at the helm until 1943."
OCH_,"OCHS.    	Adolph Ochs was a former owner of 'The New York Times'. Ochs had purchased a controlling interest in 'The Chattanooga Times' when he was only 19 years of age, and took control of 'The New York Times' in 1896 when he was 38 years old. Soon after taking charge, Ochs coined the paper's slogan 'All the News That's Fit to Print'. It was also Ochs who moved the paper's headquarters to a new building on Longacre Square in Manhattan, which the city later renamed to the famous 'Times Square' after the newspaper. The Ochs-Sulzberger family has owned the paper ever since."
TH_TA,THETA.    	The Greek letter theta is commonly used in geometry to represent the angle between two lines (say at the corner of a triangle).
EL_HU,"ELIHU.    	Elihu Root was an American statesman, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1912 for his diplomatic work that brought ""nations together through arbitration and cooperation""."
_NN,"TNN.    	Spike TV was a 2003 relaunch of The Nashville Network (TNN) and was marketed as the first television channel for men. The station owners ran into trouble though as the director Spike Lee sued, claiming that viewers would assume he was associated with the channel because of the use of ""Spike"". The suit was settled when Lee concluded that there was no intention to trade on his name."
RO_,"ROZ.    	Roz Chast had her first cartoon publlished in ""The New Yorker"" in 1978, and has had more than 800 published since then."
_IX,"KIX.    	Kix cereal has been around since 1937, would you believe? Kix used to be just puffed grains, processed to give the characteristic shape. Then the decision was made to add sugar to get better penetration into the young kid marketplace. Sad really ..."
PESC_,"PESCI.    	Joe Pesci got his big break in movies with a supporting role in ""Raging Bull"" starring Robert De Niro, earning Pesci an Oscar nomination early in his career. There followed a string of gangster roles played alongside De Niro, namely ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". But I like Pesci's comedic acting best of all. He was marvelous in the ""Home Alone"" films, the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and my personal favorite, ""My Cousin Vinny"". Pesci gets a mention in the stage musical ""Jersey Boys"", which isn't too surprising as he is one of the show's producers."
A_TU,"ATTU.    	Attu is the westernmost island in the Aleutian chain, and so is the westernmost part of Alaska. Japanese forces took the island in October 1942, eventually landing as many as 2,900 soldiers there. In May 1943, the US Army retook the island in twenty days of fighting that is now called the Battle of Attu, the only land battle to take place on US soil during WWII. I am very proud of my father-in-law, who served in the Aleutians in WWII ..."
TE_RAN,"TEHRAN.    	After the 2009 presidential election in Iran, there were many allegations of fraud against the incumbent president and winner of the election, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Initial protests in the street were peaceful, but soon the demonstrations became very heated, rivaling the famous 1999 student protests. Ahmadinejad's main rival, Mir-Hossein Mousavi held rallies with reportedly millions of people turning out to support him. After many deaths and hundreds of arrests a partial recount was held, and the result was deemed to stand, with external overseers agreeing."
ORA_G,"ORANG.    	Orangutans are arboreal creatures, in fact the largest arboreal animals known to man. They are native to Indonesia and Malaysia, living in the rain forests. Like most species in rain forests these days, orangutans are endangered, with only two species surviving. The word ""orangutan"" is Malay, meaning ""man of the forest""."
ERA_,"ERAS.    	When looking back at the 1890s, here in America we sometimes refer to the era as the Gay Nineties. The term is associated with a time of emerging wealth in the days before income taxes were permanently levied on citizens. Back in the British Isles, the same decade is known as the Naughty Nineties, days of society scandals and the outrageous antics of the likes of Oscar Wilde."
S_A,"SHA.    	Do you remember the band ""Johnny Casino & The Gamblers"" in the movie ""Grease""? That was actually the real-world group Sha Na Na. Johnny Casino & the Gamblers sang ""Those Magic Changes"" at the high school dance, in between ""Rock'N Roll Is Here to Stay"" and ""Hound Dog"". Sha Na Na got together in the sixties, and are still performing today."

EMIN_M,"EMINEM.    	Eminem's real name is Marshall Mathers, a native of Saint Joseph, Missouri. Mathers grew up poor, raised by a single-mom as the family was abandoned by his father when he was 18 months old. Marshall and his mother moved around the country before settling in a suburb of Detroit. He didn't do well at school, and dropped out at the age of 17. But in the end he made it pretty big ..."
AR_,"ARG.    	The Iguazu River runs through both Brazil and Argentina. It empties into the larger Parana River at the point where the borders of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay join, a location known as the Triple Frontier. The Upper and Lower Iguazu is separated by the Iguazu Falls, a magnificent waterfall often featured in movies. You might remember the waterfall scenes in ""The Mission"", ""Moonraker"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""."
TR_E,TREE.    	
_LKS,"ELKS.    	The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (BPOE) was founded in 1868, and is a social club that has about a million members today. It started out as a group of men getting together in a ""club"" in order to get around the legal opening hours of taverns in New York City. The club took on a new role as it started to look out for poor families of members who passed away. The club now accepts African Americans as members (since the seventies) and women (since the nineties), but atheists still aren't welcome."
TAC_,"TACO.    	Taco Bell was founded by a former US Marine, 25-year-old Glen Bell. His first restaurant was Bell's Drive-In, located in Southern California. After opening that first establishment, Bell bought up some more restaurants including four named El Taco. He sold off the El Taco restaurants but used the name in part when he opened his first Taco Bell in 1962. Bell sold then sold franchises, with the 100th Taco Bell opening in 1967. The ex-Marine sold off the whole chain to PepsiCo in 1978, and I am guessing he made a pretty penny."
CA_N,"CAIN.    	The story of Cain and Abel not only appears in the Bible. It also features in the Qur'an, where the brothers are named Kabil and Habil."
_ENOR,TENOR.    	'Tannhäuser' is an opera by Richard Wagner. The title role is a tenor.
PE_,"PEE.    	P, Q, R, S (pee, cue, ar, ess)"
HYEN_,"HYENA.    	The highly successful stage musical ""The Lion King"" started out life as a 1994 animated feature film of the same name from the Disney studio. The film is the highest earning traditionally-animated feature of all time. The animated film ""Finding Nemo"" has made more money, but it was created using computer animation."
_MCA,"YMCA.    	""YMCA"" was released by the Village People and has been adopted as an anthem by the gay community. The song was written by Victor Willis, a straight member of the mostly gay band, and he clarifies that the lyrics are extolling the virtues of the ""YMCA"" as a source of recreation for black, urban youth. I think he might have been winking when he said that ..."

SAD_E,"SADIE.    	Sadie Hawkins is a character in Al Capp's comic strip ""Li'l Abner"". Sadie was still a spinster at the age of 35 so declared a ""Sadie Hawkins Day"" in which she chased the local men in a foot race, with marriage as the prize when one was caught. Starting in 1938, Sadie Hawkins Dances were introduced in schools across the US, to which the woman invites the man of her choosing."

_IE,"LIE.    	We are most familiar with the term 'polygraph' as the generic name for a lie detector instrument. This usage began in 1921, although the term had been around since the end of the 18th century. Back then, a polygraph was a mechanical device use to make multiple copies as something was written or drawn.

_TW,BTW.    	By the way ...
HR_,HRS.    	Hours (hrs.)
STE_OS,"STENOS.    	If you haven't seen the AMC show ""Mad Men"" then I urge you to go buy the first season on DVD and just let yourself fall under its spell. It is a great series set in the sixties, telling all that goes on in and around the advertising business on Madison Avenue in New York City. It brings you right back to the days of three-martini lunches, office affairs, and chain-smoking of cigarettes. Great stuff ..."
RA_ON,"RADON.    	Radon is a radioactive gas, a byproduct produced when uranium decays naturally in the earth. Radon gas can collect and accumulate in buildings and rooms that are particularly well insulated with very little air exchange. The danger is very real, as radon is regarded as the second most frequent cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoke."

TO_TE,"TORTE.    	A torte is a type of cake made primarily with eggs, sugar and ground nuts (but no flour)."
TR_B,"TRIB.    	The Chicago Tribune was first published in 1847. The most famous edition of the Trib was probably in 1948 when the headline was ""DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN"", on the occasion of the presidential election. When it turned out Truman had actually won, the victor picked up the paper with the erroneous headline and posed for photographs with it ... a famous, famous photo, that must have stuck in the craw of the editor at the time."
T_R,"TSR.    	Dungeons & Dragons is a complex role-playing game first published in 1974, by Tactical Studies Rules Incorporated (TSR). Dungeons & Dragons was probably the first of the modern role-playing games to be developed, and the most successful. It is still played by lots of people today, including my nerdy son ..."
VE_,"VET.    	I'm note sure about this one ... a 'veteran' might call the shots in a military sense, maybe? A 'veterinarian' might call for hypodermic shots for a dog or cat, perhaps?"
E_E,EWE.    	Hampshire (also called Hampshire Down) is a breed of sheep. The breed is native to the Hampshire Downs in the South of England.
R_LO,"ROLO.    	Rolo was a hugely popular chocolate candy in Ireland when I was growing up. Rolo was introduced in the thirties in the UK, and is produced under license in the US by Hershey. I was a little disappointed when I had my first taste of the American version as the center is very hard and chewy, whereas the recipe used on the other side of the Atlantic calls for a soft gooey center."
EG_ET,"EGRET.    	The Everglades are a tropical wetlands that cover much of southern Florida. The area was named 'River Glades' by a British surveyor in 1773, and is suggested that poor transcription of the word 'river' led to the use of 'ever'. The southern 20% of the Everglades is a protected region that we know as Everglades National Park. The park is the third largest National Park in the lower 48 states, after Death Valley NP (the largest) and Yellowstone NP."
AB_ER,"ABNER.    	""Li'l Abner"" was a comic strip created and drawn by Al Capp for over 43 years starting in 1934. Al Capp stopped producing the strip in 1977, largely due to illness (he died from emphysema two years later). As the strip finished up, he went so far as to apologize to his long-standing fans, saying that he should have stopped 3-4 years earlier as he felt that the quality of his work had gone down in those latter years."
N_OBE,"NIOBE.    	In Greek mythology, when her children were killed, Niobe fled to Mt. Sipylus where she was turned into stone and wept for eternity. There is in fact a Niobe's Rock on Mt. Sipylus that resembles a female face, and so is known as ""The Weeping Rock""."
E_INEM,"EMINEM.    	Eminem's real name is Marshall Mathers, a native of Saint Joseph, Missouri.

PEP_I,"PEPSI.    	The Pepsi-Cola formulation was developed by one Caleb Bradham who made the drink at home and sold it as 'Brad's Drink'. Bradham's aim was to provide a drink that was pleasant to taste, that would aid digestion and boost energy. Included in the formula were pepsin (a digestive enzyme) and kola nuts. These two ingredients inspired the brand name we use today, Pepsi-Cola."
AI_,"AIT.    	Aits are little islands found in a river. Aits aren't formed by erosion, but by the deposition of silt over time. As a result, aits often have a long and narrow shape running parallel to the banks as the sediment builds up with the flow of the water. Many of the islands in the River Thames in England have been given the name 'Ait', like Raven's Ait in Kingston-upon-Thames, and Lot's Ait in Brentford."
VE_,"VET.    	Veterans Day used to be known as Armistice Day, and is observed on November 11th each year. This particular date was chosen as the Armistice that ended WWI was signed on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918."
_LEO,"CLEO.    	The 1963 movie ""Cleopatra"" really was an epic work. It was the highest grossing film of the year, taking in $26 million dollars at the box office, yet it still lost money. The original budget for the film was just $2 million, but so many things went wrong that the final cost swelled to a staggering $44 million dollars, making it the second most expensive movie ever made (taking into account inflation). Elizabeth Taylor was supposed to earn a record amount of $1 million for the film, and ended up earning seven times that amount due to delays. But she paid dearly, as she became seriously ill during shooting and had to have an emergency tracheotomy to save her life. The scar in her throat can actually be seen in some of the shots in the film."
HES_,"HESS.    	The Hess Corporation is an oil company based in New York City. In 1964, the company started selling toy trucks with the Hess logo on them, in Hess gas stations. The company has been selling them every since, bringing out new models just before Christmas. Hess toy trucks have become quite collectible and the old ones can fetch a pretty penny."
ERS_,"ERST.    	Erstwhile means ""in the past"" or ""once upon a time""."
P_M,PAM.    	PAM cooking oil was introduced in 1961 by Leon Rubin and Arthur Meyerhoff. The name 'PAM' is an acronym ... standing for 'Product of Arthur Meyerhoff'. Who'd a thunk it ...?
LI_GE,"LIEGE.    	A liege was a feudal lord, one to whom service or allegiance was owed under feudal law. ""Liege"" was also the term used for one who owed allegiance or service to a lord. Very confusing ..."
CARA_,"CARAT.    	A carat is a unit of mass used to measure gemstones and pearls. There are one hundred points in a carat, each equal to 2 milligrams. So a carat is equal to 200 milligrams."
UL_ER,"ULCER.    	A peptic ulcer, until fairly recently, was believed to be caused by undue amounts of stress in one's life. It is now known that 70-90% of all peptic ulcers are in fact associated with a particular bacterium."
GA_,"GAR.    	The fish known as a gar is very unusual in that it is often found in very brackish water. What is interesting about gar is that their swim bladders are vascularized so that they can actually function as lungs. Many species of gar can actually be seen coming to the surface and taking a gulp of air. This adaptation makes it possible for them to live in conditions highly unsuitable for other fish that rely on their gills to get oxygen out of the water. Indeed, quite interesting ..."
CLAR_,"CLARA.    	The Santa Clara Valley, just a few miles from me at the south of San Francisco Bay, is better known as ""Silicon Valley"". The term ""Silicon Valley"" dates back to 1971 when it was apparently first used in a weekly trade newspaper called ""Electronic News"" in articles written by journalist Don Hoefler."
_RNE,"ORNE.    	Orne is a department and river in the northwest of France. Perhaps one of the most famous locations in Orne is the village of Camembert, the home of the famous (and delicious!) cheese."
_IPO,"LIPO.    	Liposuction dates back to the 1920s, developed by a surgeon in France. However, the procedure quickly lost favor when a French model developed gangrene after surgery. As a result it wasn't until the mid-seventies that the modern liposuction gained favor, after being popularized by two Italian-American surgeons in Rome."
O_HEA,"O'SHEA.    	Milo O'Shea was a great Irish character actor from Dublin who has appeared in everything from ""Romeo and Juliet"" to ""The West Wing"". Sadly, O'Shea passed away in 2013 in New York City."
_NOL,"ENOL.    	An enol is an alkene with a hydroxyl group, sort of part-alkene and part-alcohol. The term ""enol"" therefore, is a portmanteau of ""alkene"" and ""alcohol""."
TO_ER,"TONER.    	The key features of a laser printer (or copier) are that it uses plain paper and produces quality text at high speed. Laser printers work by projecting a laser image of the printed page onto a rotating drum that is coated with photoconductors (material that becomes conductive when exposed to light). The areas of the drum exposed to the laser carry a different charge than the unexposed areas. Dry ink (toner) sticks to the exposed areas due to electrostatic charge. The toner is then transferred to paper by contact and is fused into the paper by the application of heat. So, that explains why paper coming out of a laser printer is warm, and sometimes powdery."
_AN,"TAN.    	In the year 2000 the Crayola company, very cleverly I think, held the 'Crayola Color Census 2000' in which people were polled and asked for their favorite Crayola colors. President George W. Bush chose 'Blue Bell' and Tiger Woods chose 'Wild Strawberry'."
LEO_E,"LEONE.    	The leone is the currency of Sierra Leone. It was introduced in 1964 to replace the British West African pound. The move was a practical one, as the Leone is a decimal currency and replaces the old British system of pounds, shillings and pence."
ID_E,"IDEE.    	In French, an idea (idée) is a flash of inspiration (flash d'inspiration)."
K_C,"KFC.    	The famous ""Colonel"" of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame was Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur from Henryville, Indiana. Although not really a ""Colonel"", Sanders did indeed serve in the military. He enlisted in the Army as a private in 1906 at the age of 16, lying about his age. He spent the whole of his time in the Army as a soldier in Cuba. It was much later, in the 1930s, that Sanders went into the restaurant business making his specialty deep-fried chicken. By 1935 his reputation as a ""character"" had grown, so much so that Governor Ruby Laffoon of Kentucky gave Sanders the honorary title of ""Kentucky Colonel"". Later in the fifties, Sanders developed his trademark look with the white suit, string tie, mustache and goatee. When Sanders was 65 however, his business failed and in stepped Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's. Thomas simplified the Sanders menu, cutting it back from over a hundred items to just fried chicken and salads. That was enough to launch KFC into the fast food business. Sanders sold the US franchise in 1964 for just $2 million and moved to Canada to grow KFC north of the border. He died in 1980 and is buried in Louisville, Kentucky. The Colonel's secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices is indeed a trade secret. Apparently there is only one copy of the recipe, a handwritten piece of paper, written in pencil and signed by Colonel Sanders. Since 2009, the piece of paper has been locked in a computerized vault surrounded with motion detectors and security cameras."
_HEL,"SHEL.    	Author Shel Silverstein had a varied career and did a lot more than write books. Silverstein was a poet, composer, cartoonist and screenwriter among other things. One of his successful children's books is ""The Giving Tree"", which was first published in 1964. ""The GivingTree"" tells of a young boy who has a special relationship with a tree in a forest. The message of the book seems to be that the tree provides the little boy with everything he needs."
C_EO,"CLEO.    	The asp is a venomous snake found in the Nile region of Africa. It is so venomous that the asp was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as a means of execution. Cleopatra observed such executions noting that the venom brought on sleepiness without any painful spasms. When the great queen opted to commit suicide, the asp was therefore her chosen method."
RY_N,"RYAN.    	Paul Ryan was the Republican nominee for Vice President in the 2012 election, on the ticket with Mitt Romney. Off the political stage, Ryan is famous for his fitness regime. He has shared that much of his motivation to work out and to watch his diet is because there is a history of heart attacks at an early age in his family. Ryan was elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2015 after John Boehner resigned. At 45, Ryan then became the youngest Speaker since 1875."
E_ST,"ERST.    	Erstwhile means ""in the past"", ""once upon a time""."
O_AN,"ORAN.    	Oran lies on the Algerian coast, and is famous for being the port where the French Navy was largely destroyed by the British during WWII in order to avoid the French vessels falling into the hands of Nazi Germany after France surrendered. This decisive and unexpected action by the British sent a very strong message around the world that Britain was willing to fight alone against the axis powers if necessary."
T_NOR,"TENOR.    	Plácido Domingo is a Spanish tenor, from Madrid. Famously, Domingo was one of 'The Three Tenors', the performing trio that brought classical arias to the masses. The other two 'Tenors' were fellow-Spaniard José Carreras and Italian Luciano Pavarotti."
_NN,"TNN.    	The Nashville Network (TNN) was a country music cable channel that operated from 1983 to 2003. When TNN closed down it was relaunched with a completely different format as Spike, marketed as 'the first television channel for men'."
P_E,PEE.    	The leading letter in the word 'Polish' is a letter P (pee).
_YAN,"RYAN.    	I loved the Tom Clancy series of novels, most of which feature Jack Ryan as the main character, but I felt that with each successive title, my interest faded a little. I was hooked with ""The Hunt for Red October"" published in 1984, and dutifully worked my through all Clancy's subsequent novels, before giving up halfway through the 1998 ""Rainbow Six"". Tom Clancy passed away quite recently, at the beginning of October 2013. Jack Ryan has been played on the big screen a number of times, by:"
LEO_E,"LEONE.    	The Republic of Sierra Leone is a country in West Africa, lying on the Atlantic Coast. The capital city of Freetown was originally set up as a colony to house the ""Black Poor"" of London, England. These people were mainly freed British slaves of Caribbean descent, who were living a miserable life in the run-down parts of London. Perhaps to help the impoverished souls, perhaps to rid the streets of ""a problem"", three ships were chartered in 1787 to transport a groups of blacks, with some whites, to a piece of land purchased in Sierra Leone. Those who made the voyage were guaranteed British citizenship and protection. The descendants of these immigrants, and others who made the journey over the next 60 years, make up the ethnic group that's today called the Sierra Leone Creole."
_OONE,"BOONE.    	In 1774, a judge from North Carolina set up a land speculation company with the goal of establishing a British Colony by purchasing land in present-day Kentucky from the Cherokee. The speculators gave themselves the name 'Transylvania Company'. Henderson hired Daniel Boone to get the Cherokee to the negotiating table. Boone constructed what came to be known as the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap into central Kentucky. Some Cherokee leaders ended up signing the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals that ceded about 20 million acres of land, about half of present-day Kentucky."
S_AQ,"SHAQ.    	Retired basketball player Shaquille O'Neal now appears regularly as an analyst on the NBA TV show 'Inside the NBA'. Shaq has quite a career in the entertainment world. His first rap album, called 'Shaq Diesel', went platinum. He also starred in two of his own reality show: 'Shaq's Big Challenge' and 'Shaq Vs.'"

LEN_,"LENT.    	In Latin, the Christian season that is now called Lent was termed ""quadragesima"" (meaning ""fortieth""), a reference to the forty days that Jesus spent in the desert before beginning his public ministry. When the church began its move in the Middle Ages towards using the vernacular, the term ""Lent"" was introduced. ""Lent"" comes from ""lenz"", the German word for ""spring""."
SN_B,"SNOB.    	Back in the 1780s, a 'snob' was a shoemaker or a shoemaker's apprentice. By the end of the 18th century the word was being used by students at Cambridge University in England to refer to all local merchants and people of the town. The term evolved to mean one who copies those who are his or her social superior (and not in a good way). From there it wasn't a big leap for 'snob' to include anyone who emphasized their superior social standing and not just those who aspired to rank. Nowadays a snob is anyone who looks down on those considered to be of inferior standing."
SF_,"SFO.    	San Francisco International Airport (SFO) serves as the main base of operations for Virgin America (recently sold to Alaska Airlines), and is also the maintenance hub for United Airlines."

_IE,"LIE.    	'Flim-flam' is another word for a confidence trick. The term has been in use since the 1500s, would you believe?"
TO_CA,"TOSCA.    	Unlike so many operas, ""Tosca"" was a big hit right from day one, when it was first performed in 1900 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. ""Tosca"" is currently the eighth-most performed opera in America, although I've only seen it once myself."

_OS,"COS.    	The most familiar trigonometric functions are sine, cosine and tangent (abbreviated to 'sin, cos and tan'). Each of these is a ratio, a ratio of two sides of a right-angled triangle. The 'reciprocal' of these three functions are secant, cosecant and cotangent. The reciprocal functions are simply the inverted ratios, the inverted sine, cosine and tangent. These inverted ratios should not be confused with the 'inverse' trigonometric functions e.g. arcsine, arccosine and arctangent. These inverse functions are the reverse of the sine, cosine and tangent. For example, the arctangent can be read as 'What angle is equivalent to the following ratio of opposite over adjacent?'"
ES_OP,"ESTOP.    	The legal term ""estop"" means to block or stop using some legal device. The word ""estop"" comes from Old French, in which ""estopper"" means ""to stop up"" or ""to impede""."

M_CA,"MICA.    	Mica is a mineral, a sheet silicate. Thin sheets of mica are transparent and are used in place of glass in certain applications.

Mica is also used in the electronics industry, making use of its unique electrical and thermal insulating properties."
ES_,ESA.    	Madrid is the largest city in Spain and the capital. Madrid is located very close to the geographical center of the country. It is the third-largest city in the European Union (after London and Paris). People from Madrid called themselves Madrileños.
H_S,"HMS.    	'H.M.S. Pinafore' is one of my favorite of the Gilbert & Sullivan comic operas (a production we staged at high school, many moons ago).

IM_,IMS.    	Those would be Instant Messages.
Y_U,YOU.    	The opening words of the Mark Twain novel 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' are:
_APAS,"TAPAS.    	""Tapa"" is the Spanish word for ""lid"", and there is no clear rationale for why this word came to be used for an appetizer. There are lots of explanations cited, all of which seem to involve the temporary covering of one's glass of wine with a plate or item of food to either preserve the wine or give one extra space at the table."
M_ATA,"MIATA.    	The Mazda MX-5 is sold as the Miata in North America, and as the Roadster in Japan. I've always liked the looks of the Mazda Miata, probably because it reminds me so much of old British sports cars. The Miata is built in Hiroshima, Japan."
_AR,"AAR.    	The Aar (also called the ""Aare"" in German) is the longest river entirely in Switzerland. A famous spot along the Aar is the Reichenbach Falls in the center of the country, actually a series of waterfalls near the city of Meiringen.

K_C,"KFC.    	The famous ""Colonel"" of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame was Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur from Henryville, Indiana. Although not really a ""Colonel"", Sanders did indeed serve in the military. He enlisted in the Army as a private in 1906 at the age of 16, lying about his age. He spent the whole of his time in the Army as a soldier in Cuba. It was much later, in the 1930s, that Sanders went into the restaurant business making his specialty deep-fried chicken. By 1935 his reputation as a ""character"" had grown, so much so that Governor Ruby Laffoon of Kentucky gave Sanders the honorary title of ""Kentucky Colonel"". Later in the fifties, Sanders developed his trademark look with the white suit, string tie, mustache and goatee. When Sanders was 65 however, his business failed and in stepped Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's. Thomas simplified the Sanders menu, cutting it back from over a hundred items to just fried chicken and salads. That was enough to launch KFC into the fast food business. Sanders sold the US franchise in 1964 for just $2 million and moved to Canada to grow KFC north of the border. He died in 1980 and is buried in Louisville, Kentucky. The Colonel's secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices is indeed a trade secret. Apparently there is only one copy of the recipe, a handwritten piece of paper, written in pencil and signed by Colonel Sanders. Since 2009, the piece of paper has been locked in a computerized vault surrounded with motion detectors and security cameras."
E_INEM,"EMINEM.    	Eminem's real name is Marshall Mathers, a native of Saint Joseph, Missouri.

TR_B,"TRIB.    	Ed Asner's Lou Grant character originated of course on the ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". Asner had to play a wide range of emotions in that role, and did so very ably.

Followers of the Sunni tradition agree with the decision that the Prophet Muhammad's confidant Abu Bakr was the right choice to become the first Caliph of the Islamic nation.

_OLA,"COLA.    	The Pepsi-Cola formulation was developed by one Caleb Bradham who made the drink at home and sold it as 'Brad's Drink'. Bradham's aim was to provide a drink that was pleasant to taste, that would aid digestion and boost energy. Included in the formula were pepsin (a digestive enzyme) and kola nuts. These two ingredients inspired the brand name we use today: Pepsi-Cola."

The crime turned out to be not quite so perfect and the pair were caught and put on trial for the murder. The trial was big news, especially after the defendants engaged high-profile attorney Clarence Darrow to represent them. In fact, the court proceedings were dubbed 'The Trial of the Century'.
