The most important active constituents are calcium hydroxide (""slake lime"") and sodium hydroxide (""caustic soda"").

BOC_,"BOCA.    	The name of the city of Boca Raton in Florida translates from Spanish as 'Mouse Mouth'. There doesn't seem to be a definitive etymology of the name but one plausible explanation is a nautical one. 'Boca', as well as meaning 'mouth' can mean 'inlet'. 'Rat√≥n', as well as meaning 'mouse' was also used to describe rocks that chewed away at a ship's anchor cable. So possibly Boca Raton was named for a rocky inlet."
BL_U,"BLEU.    	The French national flag is a tricolor of blue, white and red. The blue and red colors in the flag date back to the French Revolution, when the Paris militia that participated in the storming of the Bastille wore a cockade of blue and red.

Although Kidd was a privateer, someone authorized by the government to attack foreign shipping, he was eventually arrested and executed for piracy.

_ANE,"KANE.    	""Citizen Kane"" was the first film made by Orson Welles, one considered by many to be the finest film ever made. It's a remarkable achievement by Wells, as he played the lead, and also produced and directed. Despite all the accolades for ""Citizen Kane"" over the decades, the movie was far from a commercial success in its early run and actually lost money at the box office. The main character is Charles Foster Kane, who is based mainly on the real-life newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst."
T_BLE,"TABLE.    	These ""tabling"" and ""shelving"" idioms drive me crazy, because they are always misused. If a topic is shelved, it is set aside. If a topic is tabled, it is brought ""off the shelf"" and put 'on the table' for discussion. But, maybe it's just me ..."
UMA_S,"UMASS.    	The University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) is the largest public university in New England. UMass was founded back in 1863, although it took a while to get the school into service. Construction work was delayed and the college went through two presidents before William S. Clark took charge.

As a result, although Clark was the third President of UMass, he is regarded by most as the school's founding father."

BAL_A,"BALSA.    	Balsa is a very fast growing tree that is native to parts of South America. Even though balsa wood is very soft, it is actually classified as a hardwood, the softest of all the hardwoods (go figure!). Balsa is light and strong, so is commonly used in making model airplanes. Amazingly, in WWII a full-size British plane, the de Havilland Mosquito, was built largely from balsa and plywood. No wonder they called it ""The Wooden Wonder"" and ""The Timber Terror""."

He wrote an autobiography called ""Open"", published in 2009. An amazing revelation in the book is that Agassi's famous head of hair was actually a wig for much of his playing career. Can you imagine how hard it must have been to play tennis at his level with a rug stuck on?"
_ORAG,"DO-RAG.    	Hip-hoppers might wear do-rags today, but they have been around for centuries. If you recall the famous image of Rosie the Riveter, she was wearing a do-rag. The etymology is pretty evident, a piece of cloth (rag) to hold a hairstyle (do) in place."

Malta played a crucial role for the Allies during WWII as it was located very close to the Axis shipping lanes in the Mediterranean. The Siege of Malta lasted from 1940 to 1942, a prolonged attack by the Italians and Germans on the RAF and Royal Navy, and the people of Malta.

It had a unique front-wheel-drive layout that took up very little space, allowing for a lot of room (relatively speaking) for passengers and baggage. One space-saving trick was to mount the engine transversely, so it sits rotated 90 degrees from the norm. That engine had a capacity of only 848cc.

My favorite number though, has to be ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls"" sung by Maurice Chevalier. Many say that 'Gigi' is the last in the long line of great MGM musicals. It won a record 9 Academy Awards, a record that only lasted one year. Twelve months later 'Ben Hur' won 11 Oscars. In the 1958 film, Gigi was played by the lovely Leslie Caron.
