One story is that it was taken from the Detroit Light Guard military unit who were known as ""The Tigers"".

In a sense, it is similar to this blog. Here I send out a post once a day containing information that I think might be useful to folks (thank you for reading!). I don't think I could send out much of interest using just 140 characters. I believe that many people who do tweet tend to send out messages like ""I'm at dinner now. I am having sushi"" and ""There's nothing on TV. I'm bored"". Nope, I don't think so!"

Doyle Brunson published a poker strategy guide in 1978, and this really helped increase the popularity of the game.

Piranhas are not in fact strict carnivores, and usually are more of a nuisance to fishermen rather than a danger, as they tend to eat bait that has been set to catch other fish. Much of the reputation of the piranha is owed to the description written by President Theodore Roosevelt in his book ""Through the Brazilian Wilderness"".

My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The old theater's seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the storyline is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even smoking cigarettes. On cue, the stagehands would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the musical version of the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

B_WELVE,"B-TWELVE.    	Vitamin B12 is a water soluble vitamin that plays a role in the function of the brain and the nervous system. Folks like me who don't eat any animal foods have to watch out for vitamin B12 as it is the one food substance that isn't readily available from plant sources. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria readily found in ""dirt"" so it is readily ingested by animals and passed onto humans via diary products or meat. As we have to be so careful about washing our vegetables because of the use of pesticides, humans aren't readily exposed to vitamin B12 when eating vegetables, so vegans often take supplements. Personally, as a potato-eating Irishman who always eats the skins of the potato, and doesn't wash them too much when they come in from the garden, I've always had loads of B12 in my blood when it has been tested, without any supplements. I guess the message is ""eat dirt"" ..."

OL_STRA,"OLESTRA.    	Olean is a brand name for the fat substitute, Olestra. Naturally occuring fats are made of a glycerol molecule holding together three fatty acids. Olestra is instead made of a sucrose molecule holding together several fatty acid chains. Olestra has a similar taste and consistency as natural fat, but has zero caloric impact on the body as it is too large a molecule to pass through the intestinal wall and passes right out of the body. Personally, I would steer clear of it. Olestra is banned in Britain and Canada due to concerns about side effects, but I guess someone knows the right palms to grease (pun intended!) here in the US, so it's in our food."

As I discovered on my visit, there are five known copies of Lincoln's Gettysburg address and all of them differ in some way or another, so I suppose the exact words spoken will never be known. Martin Luther King Jr. evoked Abraham Lincoln's words in another of America's iconic addresses, his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Lincoln's speech began with ""Four score and seven years ago ..."", and King's speech began with ""Five score years ago ..."" as a nod to the Gettysburg Address."

S_TA,"SETA.    	The word ""gecko"" comes from an Indonesian/Javanese word ""tokek"", which is imitative of the reptile's chirping sound. In making such a sound, geckos are unique in the world of lizards. More interesting to me than a gecko's chirping is its ability to cling to walls and to other vertical surfaces. Their feet are specially adapted with ""toes"" that make extremely intimate, close contact to a surface. The toes have millions of hairs called setae that enable the clinging. It isn't suction that supports them, but rather van der Waals forces (weak ""gravitational"" attractions). Fascinating stuff ..."

COUSI_,"COUSIN.    	In the most general terms, a cousin is anyone with whom one shares a common ancestor. Cousins in one's immediate family are of course usually called by a more direct term (father, brother, uncle etc.). Two cousins are pinpointed in a family tree by using 'degree' and 'removal' to describe the relationship. For example, first cousins (first-degree cousins) share a common grandparent, and second cousins share a common great-grandparent, and so on up the tree. If the two cousins share the same common ancestor but there is a generational difference, then the 'removal' term is used. So, if you share as a common ancestor your great-grandparent with one of your cousins, that person is your second cousin, unless that cousin is of a different generation in which case the number of generations ""removed"" is also specified. If that person regards your great-grandfather as his/her great-great grandfather, then you are still second cousins but more specifically are second cousins once removed (i.e. one generation removed).

Ricotta is actually produced from the whey of the milk, the liquid left after the curds have been separated out (curds are used to make ""traditional"" cheese).

The word ""ricotta"" literally means ""recooked"", which makes sense to me now ..."
