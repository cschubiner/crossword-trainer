My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The theater seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the story is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even having a cigarette. On cue they would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

_SN,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the age of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

Ludlum wrote two sequels, and all three parts of the Bourne Trilogy have been made into very successful movies now, starring Matt Damon in the title role.

She appeared in her first movies at 17, with her most acclaimed early role being CÃ©cile de Volanges in 1988's 'Dangerous Liaisons'. Thurman's career really took off when she played the gangster's 'moll' in Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' in 1994. My favorite of all Thurman's movies is 'The Truth About Cats & Dog's', a less acclaimed romcom released in 1996. She took a few years off from 1998 until 2002, doing very little work in favor of motherhood. It was Tarantino who relaunched her career, giving her the lead in the 'Kill Bill' films."

The show opened in London in 1985, and is the longest running musical in the history of London's West End. My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The theater seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the storyline is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even having a cigarette. On cue they would get up and catch a dropped rifle or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the storyline seemed to get lost ..."

S_N,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an 'identity number' to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the age of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents 'disappeared'."

There are also movie adaptations of two of the novels: "" Meet Nero Wolfe"" (1936) which features a young Rita Hayworth, and ""The League of Frightened Men"" (1937).

OTI_,"OTIS.    	Escalators have an advantage over elevators in that they can move larger numbers of people in the same time frame. They can also be placed in just about the same physical space that would be needed for a regular staircase. Patents for escalator-type devices were first filed in 1859, but the first working model wasn't built until 1892 by one Jesse Reno. It was erected alongside a pier in Coney Island, New York, with the second escalator being placed at an entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge. Soon after, Elisha Otis and the Otis elevator company purchased the necessary patents and went into the business."

I_S,IRS.    	Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
A_A,"ADA.    	Back in 1889, Jeff Reed was hired to carry the mail between the two communities of Stonewall and Center in what was then called the Indian Territory. Reed had moved to the area from Texas, and he bought some land in between the two limits of his mail route and built himself a log cabin. Pretty soon other settlers built homes nearby, and in 1891 the settlement got its own post office. As postman, Reed got to name the new post office and he called it Ada, after his oldest daughter. Ada is now a county seat and has over 17,000 residents. One of the sons of the city of Ada was the televangelist Oral Roberts."
REN_,"RENE.    	Belgian artist RenÃ© Magritte was a surrealist. His most recognized work maybe is ""The Son of Man"", a painting he created as a self-portrait.

U_A,"UMA.    	I""m not a big fan of director Quentin Tarantino. His movies are too violent for me, and the size of his ego just turns me right off. Having said that, I think ""Pulp Fiction"" is a remarkable film. If you can look past the violence it's really well written. And what a legacy it has. John Travolta's career was on the rocks and he did the film for practically no money, and it turned out be a re-launch for him. Uma Thurman became a top celebrity overnight from her role. Even Bruce Willis got some good out of it, putting an end to a string of poorly received performances."
A_P,"ASP.    	""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is, in my humble opinion, the best of the Indiana Jones franchise of movies. This first Indiana Jones film was released in 1981, produced by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg. Harrison Ford was Spielberg's first choice to play the lead, but Lucas resisted as he was concerned that he would be too closely associated with the actor (as Ford played Han Solo in ""Star Wars"", and also appeared in Lucas's ""American Graffiti""). Tom Selleck was offered the role but couldn't get out of his commitments to ""Magnum, P.I."" Eventually Spielberg got his way, and that was a good thing I'd say ..."

Cleopatra observed such executions noting that the venom brought on sleepiness without any painful spasms. When the great queen opted to commit suicide, the asp was therefore her chosen method."
O_CA,"ORCA.    	Shamu was the name of the third orca, or killer whale, ever to be featured in a public exhibition. Shamu starred in a popular SeaWorld show in San Diego in the sixties.

At the Fair, Otis would stand on an elevated platform in front of onlookers and order his assistant to cut the single rope holding up the platform. His safety system kicked in when the platform had only fallen a few inches, amazing the crowd. After this demonstration, the orders came rolling in."

_LK,"ELK.    	The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (BPOE) was founded in 1868, and is a social club that has about a million members today. It started out as a group of men getting together in a ""club"" in order to get around the legal opening hours of taverns in New York City. The club took on a new role as it started to look out for poor families of members who passed away. The club now accepts African Americans as members (since the seventies) and women (since the nineties), but atheists still aren't welcome."

She was married for 40 years to Mel Brooks, right up till her passing in 2005."
A_A,"ADA.    	Ada Lovelace's real name was Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace. She was the only legitimate child of Lord Byron, the poet. Lovelace was fascinated by mathematics and wrote about the work done by Charles Babbage in building his groundbreaking mechanical computer. In some of her notes, she proposed an algorithm for Babbage's machine to compute Bernoulli numbers. This algorithm is recognized by many as the world's first computer program and so Lovelace is sometimes called the first 'computer programmer'."

Eton is noted for producing many British leaders including David Cameron who took power in the last UK general election.

INC_,"INCA.    	Quechua was the existing Native American language that was adopted and by the Incan Empire and favored over other dialects. Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro discovered the Incas in 1526, the beginning of the end for the ancient civilization, ravaged by force and by imported smallpox."

NE_O,"NERO.    	""I, Claudius"" is a 1934 novel penned by Robert Graves, written in the form of an autobiography of Emperor Claudius of Rome.

S_R,SSR.    	I think that this clue might be a little misleading. Moldavia is a geographic and historical region lying partly in Romania and partly in the Republic of Moldova.

NS_,"NSA.    	The National Security Agency was set up in 1952 by President Truman, a replacement for the Armed Forces Security Agency that had existed in the Department of Defense since 1949. The agency has always been clouded in secrecy and even the 1952 letter from President Truman that established the agency was kept under wraps from the public for over a generation. I really like the nickname given to the NSA: ""No Such Agency"" ..."
S_S,"SOS.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
_OS,"SOS.    	S.O.S is a brand name of scouring pads made from steel wool impregnated with soap. The product was invented as a giveaway by an aluminum pot salesman in San Francisco called Ed Cox. His wife gave it the name ""S.O.S"" as an acronym for ""Save Our Saucepans"". Note the punctuation! There is no period after the last S, and that is very deliberate. When Cox went to register the trademark, he found that S.O.S. could not be a trademark because it was used as an international distress signal. So, he dropped the period, and I hope made a lot of money for himself and his wife."

_SN,"SSN.    	A Social Security number (SSN) is divided into three parts i.e AAA-GG-SSSS, Originally, the Area Number (AAA) was the code for the office that issued the card. Since 1973, the Area Number reflects the ZIP code from which the application was made. The GG in the SSN is the Group Number, and the SSSS in the number is the Serial Number.

Despite its name, the electric ""eel"" isn't an eel at all, but rather what is called a knifefish, a fish with an elongated body and related to the catfish. The electric eel has three pairs of organs along its abdomen, each capable of generating an electric discharge. The shock can go as high as 500 volts with 1 ampere of current (that's 500 watts), and that could perhaps kill a human."

_SI,"CSI.    	I'm told that the TV show ""CSI"" gets a lot of razzing by law enforcement professionals for its unrealistic portrayal of the procedures and science of criminal investigation. I don't care though, as I just think it's fun television. The original ""CSI"" set in Las Vegas seems to have ""gone off the boil"", but the addition of Sela Ward to the cast of ""CSI: NY"" has really, really raised the level of the sister show centered around New York City."

In order to minimize overall mechanical wear, areas with high call volumes were given the most efficient area codes (lowest number of clicks). That led to New York getting the area code 212, Los Angeles 213 and Chicago 313."

OR_O,"OREO.    	How the Oreo cookie came to get its name seems to have been lost in the mists of time. One theory is that it comes from the French 'or' meaning 'gold', a reference to the gold color of the original packing. Another suggestion is that the name is the Greek word 'oreo' meaning 'beautiful, nice, well-done'."

_LK,"ELK.    	The elk (also known as the wapiti) is the one of the largest species of deer in the world, with only the moose being bigger. Early European settlers were familiar with the smaller red deer back in their homelands, so when they saw the ""huge"" wapiti they assumed it was a moose, and incorrectly gave it the European name for a moose, namely ""elk"". The more correct name for the beast is ""wapiti"", which means ""white rump"" in Shawnee. It's all very confusing ..."

E_O,"ELO.    	If you listen to the song ""Rockaria"" on the 1976 ELO album ""A New World Record"", you'll hear an ""oops"".

A_P,"ASP.    	In William Shakespeare's play 'Antony and Cleopatra', the heroine of the piece addresses the asp as she uses the snake to commit suicide:"
AD_,"ADA.    	The reference here is to the 1969 novel by Vladimir Nabokov called ""Ada"". The story takes place in the 1800s on Antiterra, an Earth-like planet that has a history similar to ours but with interesting differences. For example, there is a United States, but the country covers all of North and South America. What we call eastern Canada is a French-speaking province called ""Canady"", and western Canada is a Russian-speaking province ""Estody"". The plot-line is about a man called Van Veen who, when 14 years old, meets for the first time his cousin, 11-year-old Ada. The two cousins eventually have an affair, only to discover later that they are in fact brother and sister."
A_NE,"ANNE.    	Anne Rice is the American author of erotic and Gothic novels, and was born Howard Allen O'Brien (no wonder she changed her name!). Here series of novels ""The Vampire Chronicles"" centers on her character Lestat de Lioncourt, a French noble who was turned into a vampire in the 18th century. One of the stories, ""Interview with the Vampire"" was adapted for the big screen in 1994, and starred Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, as well as others in a star-studded cast. Not my kind of movie though ..."

S_S,"SOS.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
_SN,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."
LE_,LES.    	'Les Sylphides' is a 1909 ballet choreographed by Michel Fokine with music by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin. The ballet is described as non-narrative meaning that it has no story but simply showcases the dancing.

NS_,"NSA.    	The National Security Agency (NSA) was set up in 1952 by President Truman, a replacement for the Armed Forces Security Agency that had existed in the Department of Defense since 1949. The NSA has always been clouded in secrecy and even the 1952 letter from President Truman that established the agency was kept under wraps from the public for over a generation. I really like the organization's nickname ... ""No Such Agency""."

LE_,"LEO.    	Baseball player and manager Leo Durocher was noted for being outspoken, and was given the nickname ""Leo the Lip"". In 1946, while he was manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Durocher expressed the opinion that teams like his successful Dodgers would always do better than teams replete with personable individuals (naming Mel Ott in particular).

The capital city of Muscat has a strategic location on the Gulf of Oman and has a history of invasion and unrest. Centuries of occupation by the Persians ended in 1507 when the Portuguese took the city in a bloody attack.

After she died in 1971, her name lived on as the name ""Shamu"" was still used by SeaWorld for its killer whale shows. It is notable given a recent tragedy, that the original Shamu was retired after she grabbed and refused to let go of the leg of a female employee at SeaWorld."
IN_A,"INCA.    	The Inca people emerged as a tribe around the 12th century, in what today is southern Peru.

E_A,"EVA.    	Eva Marie Saint is an American actor, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for playing Edie Doyle in the 1954 movie ""On the Waterfront"". My favorite of Saint's movies is the 1959 Hitchcock classic, ""North by Northwest"", in which she starred opposite Cary Grant. She ratcheted back her career at its height, right after her success in ""North by Northwest"". Saint opted instead to spend more time with her husband and children, taking very few acting roles. That marriage is still going strong, and she has two children and three grandchildren."
ATAR_,"ATARI.    	The kids today probably don't realize that we had a video game console back in the seventies, but it wasn't a Nintendo nor a PlayStation.

_REO,"OREO.    	There's an iPhone app featuring the Oreo cookie. It's a game in which one twists Oreo cookies apart, 'licks' the cream from the center and then dunks the remainder of the cookie in a glass of milk."
LE_,LEO.    	Leo is the fifth astrological sign of the Zodiac. People born from July 23 to August 22 are Leos.
_SN,"SSN.    	A Social Security number (SSN) is divided into three parts i.e AAA-GG-SSSS, Originally, the Area Number (AAA) was the code for the office that issued the card. Since 1973, the Area Number reflects the ZIP code from which the application was made. The GG in the SSN is the Group Number, and the SSSS in the number is the Serial Number. However, this is all moot, as since 2011 SSn's are assigned randomly."

NE_,"NED.    	Ned Kelly was an Irish-Australian outlaw, regard by many as a symbol of resistance against the British ruling class in Australia in the 19th century. There have been two famous films made of his life story. 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' was released in 1906, and is recognized today as the first feature film ever made. We might be more familiar with the film called 'Ned Kelly' released in 1970, as it starred Mick Jagger in the title role."
EA_,"EAU.    	In French, ice (glace) is frozen water (eau)."
_VA,"EVA.    	Eva Marie Saint is an American actress, who won the Best Supporting Actress for playing Edie Doyle in the 1954 movie ""On the Waterfront"". My favorite of her movies is the 1959 Hitchcock classic, ""North by Northwest"", in which she starred opposite Cary Grant. Eva Marie ratcheted back her career at its height, right after her success in ""North by Northwest"". She opted instead to spend more time with her husband and children, taking very few roles. That marriage is still going strong, and she has two children and three grandchildren."
_KE,"IKE.    	There doesn't seem to be any good reason why President Eisenhower was called ""Ike"". It is known however, that it goes back to his childhood, because that's what his parents called him."
S_N,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

_ERO,"NERO.    	The Great Fire of Rome raged for five and a half days in 64 AD. Of the fourteen districts of Rome, three were completely destroyed and seven more suffered serious damage. The emperor at the time was of course Nero, although reports that he fiddled, played his lyre or sang while the city burned; those accounts are probably not true. In fact, Nero was staying outside of Rome when the fire started and rushed home on hearing the news. He organized a massive relief effort, throwing open his own home to give shelter to many of the citizens who were left living on the street."

_DE,"ODE.    	Sappho was an Ancient Greek poet born on the Greek island of Lesbos. Sappho was much admired for her work, although very little of it survives today. She was renowned for writing erotic and romantic verse that dealt with the love of women as well as men. It was because of this poetry that the word 'lesbian' (someone from Lesbos) is used to describe a gay woman."
_TON,"ETON.    	The world-famous Eton College is just a brisk walk from Windsor Castle, which itself is just outside London. Eton is noted for producing many British leaders including David Cameron who took power in the last UK general election.

C_I,"CSI.    	I'm told that the TV show ""CSI"" gets a lot of razzing by law enforcement professionals for its unrealistic portrayal of the procedures and science of criminal investigation. I don't care though, as I just think it's fun television. The original ""CSI"" set in Las Vegas seems to have ""gone off the boil"", but the addition of Sela Ward to the cast of ""CSI: NY"" has really, really raised the level of the sister show centered around New York City."
_REO,"OREO.    	The Oreo was the best-selling cookie in the 20th century, and almost 500 billion of them have been sold since they were introduced in 1912 by Nabisco. In those early days the creme filling was made with pork fat, but today vegetable oils are used instead. If you take a bite out of an Oreo sold outside of America you might notice a difference from the homegrown cookie, as coconut oil is added in the overseas version to give a different taste."

The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
