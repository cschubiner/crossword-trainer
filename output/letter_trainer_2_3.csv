_NEA,"ONE-A.    	The US government maintains information on all males who are potentially subject to military conscription, using what is called the Selective Service System(SS). In the event that a draft was held, men registered would be classified into groups to determine eligibility for service. Class 1-A registrants are those available for unrestricted military service. Other classes are 1-A-O (conscientious objector available for noncombatant service), 4-A (registrant who has completed military service) and 4-D (Minister of religion)."
A_NA,"ANNA.    	Not only is Anna Kournikova a world-class tennis player, but she is also a model. She apparently has a lot of fans because ""Kournikova"" is one of the most commonly Googled words on the Internet ..."

A_EC,"ALEC.    	Alec is the oldest of the acting Baldwin brothers. I think his big break really was playing Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan in ""The Hunt for Red October"", but thank goodness that role was taken over by Harrison Ford for the subsequent Jack Ryan movies. He is making a name for himself these days playing Jack Donaghy on ""30 Rock"", opposite Tina Fey."
OB_E,"OBOE.    	The oboe is perhaps my favorite of the reed instruments. The name ""oboe"" comes from the French ""hautbois"" which means ""high wood"". When you hear an orchestra tuning before a performance you'll note (pun intended!) that the oboe starts off the process by playing an ""A"". The rest of the musicians in turn tune to that oboe's ""A""."
_NNA,"ANNA.    	Anna Quindlen is an author, journalist and columnist who won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1992 for her 'New York Times' column 'Public and Private'."
A_HE,"ASHE.    	Arthur Ashe was a professional tennis player from Richmond, Virginia. In his youth, Ashe found himself having to travel great distances to play against Caucasian opponents due to the segregation that still existed in his home state. He was rewarded for his dedication by being selected for the 1963 US Davis Cup team, the first African American player to be so honored. Ashe continued to run into trouble because of his ethnicity though, and in 1968 was denied entry into South Africa to play in the South African Open. In 1979 Ashe suffered a heart attack and had bypass surgery, with follow-up surgery four years later during which he contracted HIV from blood transfusions. Ashe passed away in 1993 due to complications from AIDS. Shortly afterwards, Ashe was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton."

_SLE,"ISLE.    	The Isle of Man is a large island located in the middle of the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. I used to spend a lot of time there in my youth, and a very interesting place it is indeed. The Isle of Man is classed as a British Crown Dependency and isn't part of the United Kingdom at all. It is self-governing and has its own parliament called the Tynwald. The Tynwald was created in AD 979 and is arguably the oldest continuously-running parliament in the world. The inhabitants of the island speak English, although they do have their own language as well called Manx, which is very similar to Irish Gaeilge and Scottish Gaelic. And then there are those Manx cats, the ones without any tails. I've seen lots of them, and can attest that they are indeed found all over the island."
_RA,"ARA.    	The constellation of Ara takes its name from the Latin word for ""altar""."
A_EC,"ALEC.    	The full name of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel is ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented"". When it was originally published, ""Tess"" received very mixed reviews, largely because it addressed some difficult sexual themes including rape, and sexual double standards (attitudes towards men vs women). I suppose the most celebrated screen adaption is Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" released in 1979. Polanski apparently made ""Tess"" because his wife, Sharon Tate, gave him Hardy's novel as her last act before she was murdered by the Manson family. There is a dedication at the beginning of the movie that just says ""To Sharon""."
I_A,"IDA.    	Boise, Idaho is the largest metropolitan area in the state by far. There are a number of stories pertaining to the etymology of the name 'Boise'. One is that French trappers named the tree-lined river that ran through the area 'la rivière boisée', meaning 'the wooded river'. "
LO_,"LOO.    	When I was growing up in Ireland, a ""bathroom"" was a room that had a bath and no toilet. The separate room with the commode was called ""the toilet"" or sometimes the W.C. (the water closet). Apparently the term closet was used because in the 1800s when homeowners started installing toilets indoors they often displaced clothes and linens in a ""closet"", as a closet was the right size to take the commode. It has been suggested that the British term ""loo"" comes from Waterloo (water-closet ... water-loo), but no one seems to know for sure. Another suggestion is that the term comes from the card game of ""lanterloo"" in which the pot was called the loo!"

The first line is ""I've got an old mule and her name is Sal""."

_ER,"O'ER.    	The words ""o'er the land of the free"" come from ""The Star Spangled Banner"" written by Francis Scott Key. The lyrics were written first as a poem by Key, inspired by his witnessing of the bombarding by the British of the American forces at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore in September 1814. The words were then set to the tune of a popular British drinking song written by John Stafford Smith called ""The Anacreontic Song"", with Anacreontic Society being a men's club in London."

T_AR,"TSAR.    	The last ruler of Imperial Russia was Tsar Nicholas II (of the House of Romanov). Famously, the Tsar and his family were murdered in 1918 in the basement of a house in Yekaterinburg, Russia by members of the Bolshevik secret police. The Tsar's youngest daughter was 16-year-old Anastasia and rumors of her escape have persisted for years. The rumors grew with the help of numerous women who claimed to be Anastasia. In 2009, DNA testing finally proved that the remains of all of the Tsar's immediate family, including Anastasia, have been found and identified."

OTT_,"OTTO.    	Otto Preminger was noted for his films that pushed the envelope in terms of subject matter, at least in the fifties and sixties. Great examples would be 1955's ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" that dealt with drug addiction, 1959's ""Anatomy of a Murder"" that dealt with rape, and 1962's ""Advise and Consent"" that dealt with homosexuality. If you've seen these films, you'll have noticed that the references are somewhat indirect and disguised, in order to get past the censors."
R_A,"REA.    	Stephen Rea is an Irish actor, whose most famous role was that of the ""retired"" IRA man in the brilliant 1992 film ""The Crying Game"". He also starred in the chilling movie ""Stuck"", a 2007 film that is based on a true story about a woman who commits a hit-and-run on a homeless man. The woman leaves the scene of the crime with the victim still ""stuck"" in her windshield. The woman then leaves the man to die in her garage. Chilling, eh? But as I said, a true story ..."

The nose was moved to the horizontal position during flight to create the optimum aerodynamic shape thereby reducing drag.

I used to spend a lot of time there in my youth, and a very interesting place it is indeed. The Isle of Mann is classed as a British Crown Dependency, and isn't part of the United Kingdom at all. It is self-governing and has its own parliament called the Tynwald. The Tynwald was created in AD 979, and is arguably the oldest continuously running parliament in the world. The inhabitants of the island speak English, although they do have their own language called Manx, which is very similar to Irish Gaeilge and Scottish Gaelic. And then there are the Manx cats, the ones without any tails. I've seen lots of them, and can attest that they are found all over the island."

SS_,"SST.    	The most famous SuperSonic Transport (SST) was the Concorde, a plane that's no longer flying. Concorde had that famous ""droop nose"". The nose was moved to the horizontal position during flight to create the optimum aerodynamic shape thereby reducing drag, and was lowered during taxi, takeoff and landing, so that the pilot had better visibility. The need for the droop nose was driven largely by the delta-shaped wings. The delta wing necessitates a higher angle of attack at takeoff and landing than conventional wing designs, so the pilot needed the nose lowered so that he or she could see the ground."

_AS,"LAS.    	Back in the 1800s, the Las Vegas Valley was given its name from the extensive meadows (""las vegas"" is Spanish for ""the meadows"") present in the area courtesy of the artesian wells drilled by local farmers. Las Vegas was incorporated as a city in 1905, in the days when it was a stopping-off point for pioneers travelling west. It eventually became a railroad town, although with the coming of the railroad growth halted as travelers began to bypass Las Vegas. The city's tourism industry took off in 1935 with the completion of the nearby Hoover Dam, which is still a popular attraction. Then gambling was legalized, and things really started to move. Vegas was picked, largely by celebrated figures in ""the mob"", as a convenient location across the California/Nevada state line that could service the vast population of Los Angeles. As a result, Las Vegas is the most populous US city founded in the 20th century (Chicago is the most populous city founded in the 19th century, just in case you were wondering)."

This means that the underlying cheese has been aged for a minimum of 17 weeks."

A_EC,"ALEC.    	Alec Waugh was the older brother of the more famous Evelyn Waugh. Both were successful novelists (Evelyn of ""Brideshead Revisited"" fame), but what I like about Alec is that he supposedly invented the cocktail party.

_OO,"LOO.    	When I was growing up in Ireland, a ""bathroom"" was a room that had a bath and no toilet. The separate room with the commode was called ""the toilet"" or sometimes the W.C. (the water closet). Apparently the term closet was used because in the 1800s when homeowners started installing toilets indoors they often displaced clothes and linens in a ""closet"", as a closet was the right size to take the commode. It has been suggested that the British term ""loo"" comes from Waterloo (water-closet ... water-loo), but no one seems to know for sure. Another suggestion is that the term comes from the card game of ""lanterloo"" in which the pot was called the loo!"
