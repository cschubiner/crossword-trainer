The event gets a lot of coverage, so it boosts the local economy as journalists hit the town. It is a very successful fundraiser for the Republican Party in Iowa as well, but the usefulness of the straw poll in predicting the eventual winner of the nomination is less clear.

His reports written during WWII in Europe, stressing the experiences of soldiers in the front lines, won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1944. After Germany surrendered he decided to follow the war in the Pacific. One day towards the end of the war, Pyle was traveling in a jeep on the island of le Shima in the Okinawa Islands when he was hit by enemy machine gun fire and was killed.

_CA,"RCA.    	During WWI, the US government actively discouraged the loss of certain technologies to other countries, including allies. The developing wireless technologies were considered to be particularly important by the army and navy. The government prevented the General Electric Company from selling equipment to the British Marconi Company, and instead facilitated the purchase by GE of the American Marconi subsidiary. This purchase led to GE forming the Radio Corporation of America, the forerunner to todays RCA brand. The Department of Justice forced GE to give their ownership of RCA in 1930s due to antitrust concerns. Paradoxically, GE purchased RCA in 1985, and then broke it the company in 1986."
A_TA,"ASTA.    	Asta is the wonderful little dog in the superb movie ""The Thin Man"" starring William Powell and Myrna Loy (as Nick and Nora Charles). In the original story by Dashiell Hammett, Asta was a female Schnauzer, but on screen Asta was played by a wire-haired fox terrier called ""Skippy"". Skippy was also the dog in ""Bringing up Baby"" with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, the one who kept stealing the dinosaur bone. Skippy retired in 1939, so Asta was played by other dogs in the remainder of ""The Thin Man"" films."

_NG,"ANG.    	Taiwanese director Ang Lee sure has directed a mixed bag of films, mixed in terms of genre but not in terms of quality. He was at the helm for such classics as ""Sense & Sensibility"" (my personal favorite), ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hulk"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Life of Pi""."
_DU,"EDU.    	A domain name is basically the address of a website on the Internet. Some time ago I moved this website to a new address (from www.puzzle.paxient.com to www.NYTCrossword.com). Like in the real world, one pays for an address. I now own (well rent!) both of the addresses I've used for this blog, but choose to ""do business"" i.e. publish the blog, at the more memorable address NYTCrossword.com. It's sort of like preferring to have a Park Avenue address instead of one on say Elm Street. In the Internet world, the address is intended to indicate what type of activity goes on at a particular address. So an address with "".com"" implies a ""company"" website, a "".org"" implies a non-profit website and "".edu"" implies an education website. But, in reality anyone can rent whatever address they want, as it just goes to the highest bidder. Most folks remember "".com"" addresses, so they are the most popular. "".com"" is meant to imply a ""business address"" as I say, but it can even be used to chat about crosswords!"
_DU,EDU.    	The .edu domain was one of the six original generic top-level domains specified. The complete original list is:
OPI_,"OPIE.    	The Opie & Anthony Show' is a talk show broadcast on XM and Sirius satellite radio. Hosts of the show are Opie Hughes and Anthony Cumia. I've turned into a bit of grouch in my old age, and I must admit that I find broadcasts like 'The Opie & Anthony Show' very puerile and offensive. Past features in the show include 'Whip 'em Out Wednesdays', 'Voyeur Bus' and 'T&A with O&A'. You get the idea ..."
AB_A,"ABBA.    	The hit musical 'Mamma Mia!' was written to showcase the songs of ABBA. I'm a big fan of ABBA's music, so I've seen this show a couple of times and just love it. 'Mamma Mia!' is such a big hit on the stage that on any given day there are at least seven performances going on somewhere in the world. There is a really interesting film version of the show that was released in 2008. I think the female lead Meryl Streep is wonderful in the movie, but the male leads, not so much ..."
AL_,"ALP.    	The Grossglockner is the highest mountain in Austria, and second highest in the Alps (the highest peak being Mont Blanc)."
_LOI,"ELOI.    	In the 1895 novel by H. G. Wells ""The Time Machine"", there were two races that he encountered in his travels into the future. The Eloi were the beautiful people, that lived on the planet's surface, while the Morlocks were basically a slave race living underground."
