A fellow Jew also passes and refuses to help. A third man stops and gives aid. This kind person is a Samaritan, a native of Samaria.

Nowadays we associate toques with chefs, as it is the name given to a chef's hat (called a ""toque blanche"" in French, a ""white hat""). A chef's toque is quite interesting.

The soap floats because the ingredients are mixed longer than necessary for homogenization, which introduces more air into the product."
_IR,"FIR.    	The custom of decorating trees at Christmas seems to have originated in Renaissance Germany. Those first trees were placed in guildhalls and were decorated with sweets and candy for the apprentices and children. After the Protestant Reformation, the Christmas tree became an alternative in Protestant homes for the Roman Catholic Christmas cribs. The Christmas tree tradition was imported into Britain by the royal family because of its German heritage. That tradition spread from Britain into North America."

Arafat was beaten by his father as a child and so did not have a good relationship with him. Arafat did not attend his father's funeral, nor did he visit his grave. The beatings were apparently administered because the young Arafat was repeatedly attending religious services in the Jewish quarter of Cairo. Arafat's explanation was that he wanted to ""study the mentality"" of the Jewish people."

_ERTS,"CERTS.    	Certs were the first breath mints to be marketed nationally in the US, hitting the shelves in 1956. A Cert is called a mint, but it isn't really as it contains no mint oil and instead has its famous ingredient named ""Retsyn"".

SMOR_S,"S'MORES.    	S'mores are a treat peculiar to North America, usually eaten around a campfire.

I've had the privilege of standing beside the original, life-size marble work on a few occasions as it is housed in the Rodin Museum, my favorite of all museums in Paris.

Over time the AFL became dominated by craft unions, unions representing skilled workers of particular disciplines. In the early thirties, John L. Lewis led a movement within the AFL to organize workers by industry, believing this would be more effective for the members.

W_Z,"WIZ.    	""The Wiz"", the 1975 musical, was written by Charlie Smalls and is an African-American adaptation of Baum's ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"". The film version of the stage show was released in 1978, starring Diana Ross as Dorothy and Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow. I haven't seen it, though. ""The Wizard of Oz"" scares me, as the flying monkeys creep me out. There, I've admitted it in public ..."
ASHANT_,"ASHANTI.    	Ashanti Douglas is an American R&B singer who uses just ""Ashanti"" as her stage name."
BL_,"BLU.    	A CD player reads the information on the disc using a laser beam. The beam is produced by what's called a laser diode, a device similar to a light-emitting diode (LED) except that a laser beam is emitted. That laser beam is usually red in CD and DVD players.

_IB,"FIB.    	To ""fib"" is to ""to tell a lie"". The term likely comes from ""fibble-fable"" meaning ""nonsense"", itself derived from ""fable""."
H_WN,"HAWN.    	I remember watching the ditsy Goldie Hawn character on ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"". Hawn used to give great performances on the show, convincing everyone that she was the stereotypical dumb blonde. Well, what a career she was to carve out for herself!"
_PCIT,"OP CIT.    	Op. cit. is short for ""opus citatum"", Latin for ""the work cited"". Op. cit. is used in footnotes to refer the reader to an earlier citation. It is similar to ""ibid"", except that ibid refers the reader to the last citation, the one immediately above."

SLO_E,"SLOPE.    	The slope or gradient of a straight line is the ratio of the 'rise' (delta y) to the 'run' (delta x). If there is no difference in the values of y for all points in a line that delta y is zero, and the slope is zero. If the values of y are all the same, then the line is horizontal."
O_ATOR,ORATOR.    	'To stump' can mean to go on a speaking tour during a political campaign. This peculiarly American term dates back to the 19th century. Back then a 'stump speech' was an address given by someone standing on a large tree stump that provided a convenient perch to help the speaker get his or her message across to the crowd.
ISA_K,"ISAAK.    	Chris Isaak is not only a rock musician, but also has had a lot of acting parts. Isaak had small roles in movies like ""Married to the Mob"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but I remember him as astronaut Ed White in the fabulous HBO miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon""."

AZ_,"AZT.    	AZT is the abbreviated name for the drug azidothymidine, much used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. AZT was originally developed in the seventies as a potential treatment for retroviruses (cancer-causing viruses), although it was never approved for use in treatment. In 1984, it was confirmed that AIDS was caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), so scientists turned to known antiviral drugs in the search for a viable treatment. Burroughs-Wellcome came up with a treatment regime using AZT, and filed a patent in 1985. The patent was challenged in court but the patent expired anyway in 2005 without any decision being made. There are now at least four generic forms of AZT approved for sale in the US."

Eerily, Elliot died in the same flat (on loan from Harry Nilsson) in which the Who's drummer, Keith Moon, would die just four years later."
AN_IE,"ANGIE.    	For my money, 'Angie' is the greatest ballad ever performed by the Rolling Stones. Despite rumors to the contrary, 'Angie' doesn't refer to a particular woman. If fact, songwriter Keith Richard says that 'Angie' is a pseudonym for heroin, and the lyrics tell of his efforts to get off the drug at a detox facility in Switzerland."
_ARLA,"CARLA.    	Carla Thomas is a singer from Memphis, Tennessee who is referred to as the Queen of Memphis Soul. Carla's father was R&B singer Rufus Thomas."

S_AMS,"SPAMS.    	Apparently the term ""SPAM"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word SPAM, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""SPAM"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."

O_RED,"ON RED.    	If you're sitting behind a car that doesn't make a right on red, it may just be a rental car driven by someone from Europe. Speaking as someone who learned to drive over there, I must admit I held up a few people at red lights when I first visited this country. That's because in Europe we aren't allowed to make any move past a red light, unless there is an accompanying green arrow. So, if you're driving overseas, take care ..."
IS_W,"I SAW.    	The oft-quoted statement ""Veni, vidi, vici"" (""I came, I saw, I conquered"") is believed by many to have been written by Julius Caesar. The words date back to 47 BC and refer to the short war between Rome and Pharnaces II of Pontus."

Followers of the Sunni tradition agree with the decision that the Prophet Muhammad's confidante Abu Bakr was the right choice to become the first Caliph of the Islamic nation.
