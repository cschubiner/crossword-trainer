_SER,"YSER.    	The Yser originates in northern France and flows through Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser is often associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war, the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."

The rank of earl is used in the British peerage system and is equivalent to the rank of count in other countries.

BR_,"BRA.    	The word ""brassière"" is of course French in origin, but it isn't the word the French use for a ""bra"". In France what we call a bra is a ""soutien-gorge"", translating to ""held under the neck"". The word ""brassière"" is indeed used in France but it applies to a baby's undershirt, a lifebelt or a harness. ""Brassière"" comes from the Old French word for an ""arm protector"" in a military uniform (""bras"" is the French for ""arm"").

""Kissing the Blarney Stone"" is a ritual engaged in by oh so many tourists (indeed, I've done it myself!), but it's not a simple process. The stone is embedded in the wall of the castle, and in order to kiss it you have to sit on the edge of the parapet and lean way backwards so that your head is some two feet below your body. There is a staff member there to help you and make sure you don't fall. The Blarney Stone has been labelled as the world's most unhygienic tourist attraction! But once you've kissed it, supposedly you are endowed with the ""gift of the gab"", the ability to talk eloquently and perhaps deceptively without offending. The term 'blarney' has come to mean flattering and deceptive talk."
ELM_,"ELMO.    	St. Elmo is the patron saint of sailors. He lends his name to the electrostatic weather phenomenon (often seen at sea) known as St. Elmo's fire.

EY_E,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is the celebrated novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."

T_B,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious as it involved lots of tapping on the spacebar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to ""jump"" across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key, which could be depressed causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."

Author Erle Stanley Gardner was himself a lawyer, although he didn't get into the profession the easy way. Gardner went to law school, but got himself suspended after a month. So, he became a self-taught attorney and opened his own law office in Merced, California. Understandably, he gave up the law once his novels became successful."

I read her book ""Without a Doubt"" a few years ago, and she pointed out one trait of Judge Ito that I think is quite telling. Ito would almost always refer to the prosecutor by her first name ""Marcia"", while addressing the male attornies on both sides of the case with the honorific ""Mister""."

_YRE,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is of course the novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."

Both of these works were originally released as album musicals, and very successful ones at that (I remember buying them when they first came out). For the original album's cast they chose Irish singer Colm Wilkinson (or C. T. Wilkinson, as we know him back in Ireland) to play Che, the narrator of the piece. 'Evita' was made into a film in 1996, with Madonna playing the title role."

Y_ER,"YSER.    	The Yser originates in northern France and flows through Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser is often associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war, the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."

N_AP,"NEAP.    	Tides of course are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the oceans. At neap tide, the smaller gravitational effect of the sun cancels out some of the moon's effect.

While travelling, Guevara was moved by the plight of the people he saw and their working conditions and what he viewed as capitalistic exploitation. In Mexico City he met brothers Raul and Fidel Castro and was persuaded to join their cause, the overthrow of the US-backed government in Cuba. He rose to second-in-command among the Cuban insurgents, and when Castro came to power Guevara was influential in repelling the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing Soviet nuclear missiles to the island. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to continue his work as a revolutionary. He was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967, and was executed. Fidel Castro led the public mourning of Guevara's death, and soon the revolutionary was an icon for many left-wing movements around the world."
AS_ER,"ASNER.    	Ed Asner is most famous for playing the irascible but lovable Lou Grant on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and on the spin-off drama ""Lou Grant"". Off-screen, Asner is noted for his political activism. He served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and was very involved in the 1980 SAG strike. When ""Lou Grant"" was cancelled in 1982, despite decent ratings, there was a lot of talk that the cancellation was a move by the network against Asner personally. In fact one of Asner's activist colleagues, Howard Hesseman (who played Johnny Fever), found that his show ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" was also cancelled ... on the very same day ..."

_AB,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious as it involved lots of tapping on the spacebar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to ""jump"" across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key, which could be depressed causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."

This was more precisely defined as a strip of land 'one furrow long' (i.e. one furlong) and one furlong wide. The length of one furlong was equal to 10 chains, or 40 rods. A area of one furlong times 10 rods was one rood."

CE_,"CEO.    	Steve Jobs certainly was a business icon in Silicon Valley. I don't think it is too surprising to learn that the brilliant Jobs didn't even finish his college education, dropping out of Reed College in Oregon after only one semester. Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976, but in 1985 he was basically fired from his own company during the computer sales slump of the mid-eighties. Jobs then founded NeXT Computer, a company focused on supplying workstations to the higher education and business markets.

NI_,"NIA.    	Not only was the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", she also wrote the screenplay. The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history not to make it to number one. That record I think reflects that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came when a spin-off TV show was launched, ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It only ran for 7 episodes."
IC_,"ICI.    	Dijon is a city in eastern France, in the Burgundy region. Dijon is famous for its mustard, a particularly strong variation of the condiment. The European Union doesn't protect the name ""Dijon"" so anyone can use it on a label. That seems fair enough to me, given that 90% of the mustard made in and around Dijon is produced using mustard seed imported from Canada."
E_T,"EMT.

_AR,"EAR.    	The 1941 Disney animated film 'Dumbo' was made soon a year after the feature 'Fantasia'. 'Dumbo' was largely a commercial venture. The film was made quickly and released in theaters as soon as possible, the idea being to recoup the financial losses incurred by 'Fantasia'."
_CRE,"ACRE.    	In the Public Land Survey System, land right across the country is divided into townships and sections. A section is roughly equivalent to a square mile, 640 acres. It became the practice to refer to quarter-quarter divisions of a section, with a quarter of a quarter of a section being equal to 40 acres (check the math!). From this sprung phrases like 'lower 40' (nominally the lowest elevation 40 acres on a property) and the 'back 40' (nominally a 40 acre parcel that was undeveloped on a property, 'out the back')."

I_O,"ITO.    	Judge Lance Ito came in for a lot of criticism for his handling of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The lead prosecutor in that trial was Marcia Clark, you might recall. I read the book that's Clark wrote about the trial called ""Without a Doubt"", and she pointed out one trait of Judge Ito that I think is quite telling. Ito would almost always refer to the prosecutor as ""Marcia"", while addressing the men on both sides of the case as ""Mister""."
TA_,"TAI.    	Tai Babilonia is a retired figure skater, long time partner of Randy Gardner. The pair started skating together when she was just eight years old, and stayed together until she was 49, retiring in 2008. Babilonia is engaged to the comedian David Brenner."

He won his most recent Emmy in 2006 for his portrayal of Presidential candidate Arnold Vinick in 'The West Wing'. When it comes to the big screen, my favorite of Alda's movies is the 1978 romantic comedy ""Same Time, Next Year"" in which he starred opposite Ellen Burstyn."
_IA,"MIA.    	Mia Farrow is an energetic, award-winning actress who really hasn't looked back in her career since her first leading role, in ""Rosemary's Baby"" back in 1968. Her on-screen celebrity is matched by the interest created by her personal life. Her first husband was Frank Sinatra, a wedding in 1966 that received a lot of attention partly due to the couple's age difference (she was 21, he was 50). Her second husband was almost as famous, the magnificent musician André Previn. Farrow then moved in with Woody Allen, a relationship that famously fell apart when Farrow discovered that Allen was having a sexual relationship with Soon-Yi, one of her adopted daughters from the marriage with André Previn."
_TRIA,ATRIA.    	In modern architecture an atrium (plural 'atria' or 'atriums') is a large open space usually in the center of a building and extending upwards to the roof.

_EMO,"NEMO.    	In the 1954 movie version of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", Captain Nemo goes down with his ship. In the novel by Jules Verne, the fate of Nemo and his crew isn't quite so cut and dry, although the inference is perhaps that they did indeed head for Davy Jones's Locker."

E_S,"EOS.    	I've been using Canon EOS cameras for decades now, and have nothing but good things to say about the cameras and the lenses. The EOS name stands for Electro-Optical System, and was chosen because it evokes the name of Eos, the Titan goddess of dawn from Greek mythology."
TA_,"TAT.    	The phrase 'tit for tat', meaning some sort of retaliation, has been around an awfully long time, since the mid-1500s. It might be derived from 'tip for tap', meaning 'blow for blow'."

NE_O,"NEMO.    	""Finding Nemo"" is a 2003 animated blockbuster from Pixar. The film was the winner of the Oscar that year for Best Animated Feature. Believe it or not, ""Finding Nemo"" is the best-selling DVD of all time and, until 2010's ""Toy Story 3"", it was the highest-grossing, G-rated movie at the box office."

EA_,"EAR.    	Leonard Nimoy played the logical Mr. Spock in the original ""Star Trek"" television series. Spock has to be the most popular character on the show, and he keeps popping up in ""Star Trek"" spin offs to this day. Nimoy first worked alongside William Shatner (Captain Kirk) in an episode of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (I loved that show!), with Nimoy playing a bad guy and Shatner playing an U.N.C.L.E. recruit."
_TAH,"UTAH.    	The Utah Jazz professional basketball team moved to their current home in Salt Lake City in 1979. As one might guess from the name, the team originated in New Orleans, but only played there for five seasons. New Orleans was a tough place to be based because venues were hard to come by, and Mardi Gras forced the team to play on the road for a whole month."
A_AB,"AHAB.    	Captain Ahab is the obsessed and far from friendly Captain of the Pequod in Herman Melville's novel ""Moby Dick""."
_LIOT,"ELIOT.    	T. S. Eliot was born in New England but grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. Much of Eliot's college education was at Oxford, and clearly he became comfortable with life in England. In 1927 he became a British citizen and lived the rest of life in the UK."
A_DA,"ALDA.    	The last episode of the television series 'M*A*S*H' was actually written as a television movie, and had the title 'Goodbye, Farewell and Amen'. That last episode was the most watched TV broadcast in US history from 1983 to 2010, before being overtaken in viewership by the 2010 Super Bowl broadcast."
ER_E,"ERLE.    	I must have read all of the Perry Mason books when I was in college. I think they kept me sane when I was facing the pressure of exams. Author Erle Stanley Gardner was himself a lawyer, although he didn't get into the profession the easy way. Gardner went to law school, but got himself suspended after a month. So, he became a self-taught attorney and opened his own law office in Merced, California. Understandably, he gave up the law once his novels became successful."

_HE,"CHE.    	Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara was born in Argentina, and in 1948 he started to study medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. While at school he satisfied his need to ""see the world"" by taking two long journeys around South America, the story of which are told in Guevara's memoir later published as ""The Motorcycle Diaries"". While travelling, Guevara was moved by the plight of the people he saw and their working conditions and what he viewed as capitalistic exploitation. In Mexico City he met brothers Raul and Fidel Castro and was persuaded to join their cause, the overthrow of the US-backed government in Cuba. He rose to second-in-command among the Cuban insurgents, and when Castro came to power Guevara was influential in repelling the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing Soviet nuclear missiles to the island. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to continue his work as a revolutionary. He was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967, and was executed. Fidel Castro led the public mourning of Guevara's death, and soon the revolutionary was an icon for many left-wing movements around the world."

_AR,"EAR.    	The Basset Hound wouldn't be my favorite breed of dog, to be honest. Basset Hounds have a great sense of smell with an ability to track a scent that is second only to that of the Bloodhound. The name 'Basset' comes from the French word for 'rather low', a reference to the dog's short legs."
H_R,"HER.    	2003's 'Her' seems to be a rather unusual film, although I've only see the trailer. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as a man who develops a relationship with a computer operating system called 'Samantha', which is voiced by Scarlett Johansson."
A_NER,"ASNER.    	Ed Asner is most famous for playing the irascible but lovable Lou Grant on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and on the spin-off drama ""Lou Grant"". Off-screen, Asner is noted for his political activism. He served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and was very involved in the 1980 SAG strike. When ""Lou Grant"" was cancelled in 1982, despite decent ratings, there was a lot of talk that the cancellation was a move by the network against Asner personally. In fact one of Asner's activist colleagues, Howard Hesseman (who played Johnny Fever), found that his show ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" was also cancelled ... on the very same day ..."
AL_A,"ALDA.    	Alan Alda had a great television career, perhaps most memorably on ""M*A*S*H"". Alda won his first Emmy in 1972, for playing Hawkeye Pierce on ""M*A*S*H"".

OPE_,"OPEC.    	The OPEC cartel (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) was formally established in 1960 and has been headquartered in Vienna since 1965. The US is actually the third largest oil producer in the world (after Russia and Saudi Arabia). One reason America isn't in OPEC, even though we are a big producer, is that we import a lot more than we export. But we all probably know that already ..."

ELI_T,"ELIOT.    	George Eliot was the pen name of English novelist Mary Anne Evans. As one might think, Evans chose a male pen name in order that her work might be best appreciated in the Victorian era. Eliot wrote seven novels including 'Adam Bede' (1859), 'The Mill on the Floss' (1860), 'Silas Marner' (1861) and 'Middlemarch' (1871-72)."

A_E,"APE.    	Englishman Charles Darwin studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland but neglected his studies largely due to his interest in nature and natural history. In the early 1830s, a friend put forward Darwin's name as a candidate for the post of 'collector' on the voyage of HMS Beagle. The Beagle was intending to spend two years at sea primarily charting the coast of South America. The voyage ended up taking five years, during which time Darwin sent back copious letters describing his findings. Back in Britain these letters were published as pamphlets by a friend and so when Darwin eventually returned home in 1836, he had already gained some celebrity in scientific circles. It was while on the Beagle that Darwin developed his initial ideas on the concept of natural selection. It wasn't until over twenty years later that he formulated his theories into a scientific paper and in 1859 published his famous book 'On the Origin of the Species'. This original publication never even mentioned the word 'evolution' which was controversial even back then. It was in 1871 that Darwin addressed head-on the concept that man was an animal species, in his book 'The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex'."
EAR_,"EARL.    	In the ranking of nobles, an earl comes above a viscount and below a marquis. The rank of earl is used in the British peerage system and is equivalent to the rank of count in other countries. Other British ranks have female forms (e.g. marquis and marchioness, viscount and viscountess), but there isn't a female word for the rank of earl. A female given the same rank as an earl is known as a countess."
B_A,"BRA.    	The word ""brassière"" is of course French in origin, but it isn't the word the French use for a ""bra"". In France what we call a bra is a ""soutien-gorge"", translating to ""held under the neck"". The word ""brassière"" is indeed used in France but it applies to a baby's undershirt, a lifebelt or a harness. ""Brassière"" comes from the Old French word for an ""arm protector"" in a military uniform (""bras"" is the French for ""arm""). Later ""brassière"" came to mean ""breast plate"" and from there was used for a type of woman's corset. The word jumped into English around 1900."

_YRE,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is the celebrated novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."

N_AP,"NEAP.    	Tides of course are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the oceans. At neap tide, the smaller gravitational effect of the sun cancels out some of the moon's effect.

E_RO,"EURO.    	Euro coins are issued by all the participating European states. The reverse side is a common design used by all countries, whereas the obverse is a design specific to each nation.

O_EC,"OPEC.    	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was founded in 1960 at a conference held in Baghdad, Iraq that was attended by Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Nine more countries joined the alliance soon after, and OPEC set up headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland and then Vienna, Austria in 1965. The basic aim of OPEC was to wrench control of oil prices from the oil companies and to put it in the hands of the sovereign states that own the natural resource."

One of the most famous operations executed by Sánchez was a 1975 raid on the OPEC headquarters in Vienna in which three people were killed.

The toy's manufacturer, Tyco, originally planned to market the ""tickle"" toy as Tickle Me Tasmanian Devil (after the ""Looney Tunes"" character), but then went with ""Elmo"" after they bought the rights to use ""Sesame Street"" names."
D_S,"DTS.    	The episodes of delirium that can accompany withdrawal from alcohol are called Delirium Tremens (the DTs). The literal translation of this Latin phrase is ""trembling madness""."
A_RIA,"ATRIA.    	In modern architecture, an atrium is a a large open space, often in the center of a building and extending upwards to the roof. The original atrium was an open court in the center of an Ancient Roman house. One could access most of the enclosed rooms of the house from the atrium."
ERS_,"ERSE.    	The Gaels were speakers of one of the Erse tongues. There are actually three Erse languages: Irish, Manx (spoken on the Isle of Man) and Scots Gaelic. In their own tongues, these would be Gaeilge (in Ireland), Gaelg (on the Isle of Man) and Gàidhlig (in Scotland)."
_AM,"SAM.    	The movie ""Casablanca"" was released in January of 1943, timed to coincide with the Casablanca Conference, the high-level meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. The film wasn't a box-office hit, but gained critical acclaim, winning three Oscars including Best Picture. The signature song ""As Time Goes By"" was written many years earlier for a 1931 Broadway musical called ""Everybody's Welcome"", and was a hit in 1931 for Rudy Vallee. But today we all remember the Casablanca version, sung by Dooley Wilson (who played ""Sam"" in the film). Poor Dooley didn't get to record it as a single, due to a musician's strike in 1943, so the 1931 Rudy Vallee version was re-released that year and became an even bigger hit second time round."
IT_,"ITO.    	Michio Itō was a dancer and choreographer from Japan who had a successful career here in the US from 1916 to 1941. Itō was interned as an enemy alien the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and was accused of being a spy. In order gain his freedom, Itō opted to return to Japan in 1943. After the war he was cleared of any charges in the US and was hired by the American Occupation Command in Japan to choreograph and oversee productions for US troops."
_BEL,ABEL.    	(55. Actor Lugosi : BELA)
E_S,"EOS.    	I've been using Canon EOS cameras for decades now, and have nothing but good things to say about the cameras and the lenses. The EOS name stands for Electro-Optical System, and was chosen because it evokes the name of Eos, the Titan goddess of dawn from Greek mythology."
TBA_,"T-BAR.    	A T-bar is a type of ski lift on which the skiers are pulled up the hill in pairs, with each pair standing (not sitting!) either side of T-shaped metal bar. The bar is placed behind the thighs, pulling along the skiers as they remain standing on their skis (hopefully!). There's also a J-bar, a similar device, but with each J-shaped bar used by one skier at a time."
EY_E,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is of course the novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."
_OS,"EOS.    	In Greek mythology, Eos is the goddess of the dawn who lived at the edge of the ocean. Eos would wake each morning to welcome her brother Helios the sun. Eos was cursed with a sexual desire that could not be sated, so she abducted several young men. One of these was the Trojan prince Tithonus. Eos asked Zeus to make Tithonus immortal, and the request was granted. However, she forgot to ask for eternal youth, and so he lived forever as a helpless old man."
_BA,MBA.    	President George W. Bush graduated from Yale with an A.B. in history in 1968. He later earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School. President Bush is the only person with an MBA to have held the nation's highest office.

CS_,"CSA.    	The Confederate States of America set up government in 1861 just before Abraham Lincoln took office. The CSA conceded defeat on November 6, 1865. Jefferson Davis was selected as President of the CSA at its formation, and retained the post for the life of the government. After the Civil War he spent two years in prison before being released on bail. He wrote a well-received book, ""The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government"" that was well received, particularly in the South. He passed away in 1889 in New Orleans, at the ripe old age of 81 years."
EO_,"EOS.    	In Greek mythology, Eos is the goddess of the dawn who lived at the edge of the ocean. Eos would wake each morning to welcome her brother Helios the sun. The Roman equivalent of Eos is Aurora."
NE_O,"NEMO.    	In the 1954 movie version of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", Captain Nemo goes down with his ship. In the novel by Jules Verne the fate of Nemo and his crew isn't quite so cut and dry, although the inference is perhaps that they did indeed head for Davy Jones' Locker."
ERS_,"ERSE.    	There are actually three Erse languages. Irish, Manx (spoken on the Isle of Man) and Scots Gaelic. In their own tongues, these would be Gaeilge (in Ireland), Gaelg (on the Isle of Man) and Gaidhlig (in Scotland)."

D_L,"DSL.    	DSL originally stood for Digital Subscriber Loop, but is now accepted to mean (Asymmetric) Digital Subscriber Line. DSL is the technology that allows Internet service be delivered down the same telephone line as voice service, by separating the two into different frequency signals."
A_EL,"ABEL.    	In the story of Cain and Abel in the Book of Genesis, Cain murders his brother Abel. Subsequently, God asks Cain, 'Where is Abel thy brother?' Cain replies, 'I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?'"
_LR,"SLR.    	SLR stands for Single Lens Reflex. Usually cameras with changeable lenses are the SLR type. The main feature of an SLR is that a mirror reflects the image seen through the lens out through the viewfinder, so that the photographer sees exactly what the lens sees. The mirror moves out of the way as the picture is taken, and the image that comes through the lens falls onto unexposed film, or nowadays onto a digital sensor."
D_T,"DST.    	On the other side of the Atlantic, Daylight Saving Time (DST) is known as ""summer time"". The idea behind summer/daylight-savings is to move clocks forward an hour in spring and backwards in the fall so that afternoons have more daylight."

EM_,EMI.    	EMI is a British music company. The company name is an acronym that originally stood for Electric and Musical Industries.
_AM,"SAM.    	While I found ""American Beauty"" to be an enjoyable and interesting film (loved Annette Bening in it), I also found it very depressing. If you haven't seen it, the main story is about a man having a midlife crisis (Kevin Spacey) and developing an infatuation for his teenage daughter's flirtatious friend. Definitely worth watching, and it did get huge accolades when it was released in 1999. A blog reader kindly pointed out to me that that film's title is a reference to the American Beauty rose. The rose features prominently in the sexual fantasy sequences, with the Kevin Spacey character dreaming about the young girl lying naked on a bed of rose petals."
IT_,"ITO.    	Midori Ito is a Japanese figure skater. Ito was the first woman to land a triple/triple jump and a triple axel in competition. In fact, she landed her first triple jump in training, when she was only 8 years old ..."

_SNER,"ASNER.    	""Up"" is the tenth movie released by Pixar studios, featuring wonderful animation as we have come to expect from Pixar. The film earned itself two Academy Awards. The main voice actor is Ed Asner, whose animated persona as Carl Fredricksen was created to resemble Spencer Tracy, as Tracy appeared in his last film, 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'."

LSA_,"LSAT.    	The title ""esquire"" is of British origin, and is used differently today depending on whether one is in the US or the UK. Here in America the term is usually reserved for those practicing the law (both male and female). In the UK it is a term of gentle respect, reserved for a male who has no other title that one can use. So a mere commoner like me might receive a letter from the bank say, addressed to W. E. Butler Esq."
LAR_,"LARA.    	The actress Lara Flynn Boyle plays Donna Hayward on 'Twin Peaks', and Helen Gamble on 'The Practice'."
NO_L,"NOEL.    	'Noël' is the French word for the Christmas season, ultimately coming from the Latin word for ""birth"" (natalis). Noel has come to be used as an alternative name for a Christmas carol."
I_RE,"IN RE.    	The term ""in re"" is Latin, derived from ""in"" (in) and ""res"" (thing, matter). ""In re"" literally means ""in the matter"", and is used to mean ""in regard to"", or ""in the matter of""."
A_NER,"ASNER.    	Ed Asner is most famous for playing the irascible but lovable Lou Grant on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and on the spin-off drama ""Lou Grant"". Off-screen, Asner is noted for his political activism. He served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and was very involved in the 1980 SAG strike. When ""Lou Grant"" was cancelled in 1982, despite decent ratings, there was a lot of talk that the cancellation was a move by the network against Asner personally. In fact one of Asner's activist colleagues, Howard Hesseman (who played Johnny Fever), found that his show ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" was also cancelled ... on the very same day ..."
INR_,"IN RE.    	The term ""in re"" is Latin, derived from ""in"" (in) and ""res"" (thing, matter). ""In re"" literally means ""in the matter"", and is used to mean ""in regard to"", or ""in the matter of""."

Hamm has scored 158 international goals, more than other player in the world, male or female. Amazingly, Hamm was born with a clubfoot, and so had to wear corrective shoes when she was growing up."
T_U,"TAU.    	Tau is the 19th letter of the Greek alphabet, the letter which gave rise to our Roman ""T"". Both the letters tau (T) and chi (X) have long been symbolically associated with the cross."

Title VII of the Act prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin or religion."
_LIOT,"ELIOT.    	T. S. Eliot was born in New England but grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. Much of his college education was at Oxford. Clearly he became comfortable with life in England as in 1927 he became a British citizen, and lived the rest of his life in the UK."
YS_R,"YSER.    	The Yser originates in northern France and flows though Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser name is oft associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium, across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of its Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful, and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."
E_RE,"EIRE.    	An Irishman I may be, but I have sat through so many Samuel Beckett plays (the Irish dramatist) and I have yet to come away feeling satisfied that I spent my time well. Of course I am in the minority, as Beckett's play ""Waiting for Godot"" was once voted the most significant English language play of the 20th century. Maybe I will give 'Waiting for Godot' another chance one day, but I doubt it ..."
LA_A,"LARA.    	Lara Spencer has been co-anchor of 'Good Morning America' since 2011, working alongside Robin Roberts and George Stephanopoulos. Back in 2004/2005, PBS viewers will have seen Spencer hosting the hit show 'Antiques Roadshow'."
