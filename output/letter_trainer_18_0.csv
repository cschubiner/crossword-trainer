The equivalent command for a right turn is ""Gee!"" Just to confuse things, the same commands are used in the British Isles but with the opposite meanings in terms of left and right. That must be pretty unsettling for jet-setting plow horses ..."
H_L,"HDL.    	HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is a compound that is used to transport fats around the body. When HDL is combined with (i.e. is transporting) cholesterol, it is often called ""good cholesterol"".

BET_E,"BETTE.    	I am a huge, huge fan of Bette Midler. I love everything about the woman, her bawdy humor, her expansive personality, and of course her amazing voice. Midler will forever be associated with the 1979 film ""The Rose"", loosely based on the life of the self-destructive singer Janis Joplin, with Bette playing the lead. Midler shows that she can act in this movie, and boy does she show that she can sing. The title song was written by Amanda McBroom and became a huge hit for Midler in 1979."

G_L,"GIL.    	The 2011 Woody Allen movie called 'Midnight in Paris' is a real gem in my opinion. I've never liked Woody Allen films, to be honest, mainly because I'm not a fan of Woody Allen as an actor.

The RAF was formed during WWI on 1 April 1918, a composite of two earlier forces, the Royal Flying Corps (part of the Army) and the Royal Naval Air Service. The RAF's ""finest hour"" has to be the Battle of Britain when the vastly outnumbered British fighters fought off the might of the Luftwaffe causing Hitler to delay his plan to cross the English Channel. This outcome prompted Winston Churchill to utter the memorable words:"
M_CS,"MACS.    	Macintosh (also 'Mac') is a line of computers from Apple Inc.

Joe originated in the seventies, in an advertising campaign that ran only in Europe where sometimes he was depicted wearing a French Foreign Legion cap. He was imported to the US in 1988 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Camel brand. The big controversy surrounding the use of the camel character was that a 1991 study found that 5-6 year old children could recognize Joe Camel more readily than either Mickey Mouse or Fred Flintstone. Also, soon after Old Joe was introduced in the US, the Camel brand's share of the illegal market to underage smokers went up from 1% to just under 33%."

Over many, many centuries animals came to the water to drink and became trapped in the tar as they entered the water to quench their thirsts. The tar then preserved the bones of the dead animals. Today a museum is located right by the Tar Pits, recovering bones and displaying specimens of the animals found there. It's well worth a visit if you are in town ..."

The RAF was formed during WWI on April 1, 1918, a composite of two earlier forces, the Royal Flying Corps (part of the Army) and the Royal Naval Air Service.

His political opponents chose the Tenure of Office Act as their ""weapon"" for impeachment. The Act prevented a president from removing an appointee of a past-president without the consent of the Senate. Johnson had removed the sitting Secretary of War without consulting Congress creating the opportunity for an impeachment trial in Congress. He was acquitted though, as his opponents fell one vote shy of the majority needed. The impeachment of President Johnson was the only presidential impeachment until that of President Clinton in 1999."

At the site there is a constant flow of tar that seeps up to the surface from under the ground, a phenomenon that has been around for tens of thousands of years.

Over many, many centuries animals came to the water to drink and became trapped in the tar as they entered the water to quench their thirst. The tar then preserved the bones of the dead animals. Today a museum is located right by the Tar Pits, recovering bones and displaying specimens of the animals found there. It's well worth a visit if you are in town ..."

I_AK,"ISAK.    	Isak Dinesen was the pen name of the Danish author Baroness Karen Blixen. Blixen's most famous title by far is 'Out of Africa', her account of the time she spent living in Kenya."
_EC,"REC.    	Ping-pong is called table tennis in the UK, where the sport originated in the 1880s. It started off as an after-dinner activity among the elite, called ""wiff-waff"". To play, books were stacked in the center of a table as a ""net"", two more books served as """"rackets"", and the ball used was actually a golf ball. The game evolved over time with the rackets being upgraded to the lids of cigar boxes and the ball becoming a champagne cork (how snooty is that?). Eventually the game was produced commercially, and the sound of the ball hitting the racket was deemed to be a ""ping"" and a ""pong"", giving the sport its name."
_ESS,"MESS.    	""Mess"" first came into English about 1300 and described the list of food needed for a meal, from the Old French word ""mes"" meaning a portion of food or a course at a meal. This usage in English evolved into ""mess"" meaning a jumbled mass of anything from the concept of ""mixed food"". At the same time, the original usage in the sense of a food for a meal surfaced again in the military in the 1500s when a ""mess"" was a communal eating place."
_YAN,"DYAN.    	The actress Dyan Cannon is perhaps best known for playing Alice in the 1969 film 'Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice', for which she received a Best Actress Oscar nomination.

_AM,"JAM.    	The use of ""jam"", to mean an improvised passage performed by a whole jazz band, dates back to the late twenties. This gave rise to ""jam session"", a term used a few years later.

F_RO,"FARO.    	Faro is a card game somewhat akin to Baccarat that was popular in England and France in the 18th century. Faro made it to the Old West, where it became a favorite of Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. The origin of the name ""Faro"" is unclear.

There's another theory involving the usual suspects: Irish immigrants and famines ..."
_ORI,"LORI.    	Lori Loughlin played Rebecca Donaldson-Katsopolis on the sitcom 'Full House'. Apparently you can see her now in a spinoff of the TV show 'Beverly Hills, 90210' called, inventively enough, '90210'."

_EDORA,"FEDORA.    	A fedora is a lovely hat, I think. It is made of felt, and is similar to a trilby, but has a broader brim. ""Fedora"" was a play written for Sarah Bernhardt and first performed in 1889. Bernhardt had the title role of Princess Fedora, and on stage she wore a hat similar to a modern-day fedora. The play led to the women's fashion accessory, the fedora hat, commonly worn by women into the beginning of the twentieth century. Men then started wearing fedoras, but only when women gave up the fashion ..."
_OPE,"ROPE.    	Clue is another board game that we knew under a different name growing up in Ireland, as outside of North America Clue is marketed as ""Cluedo"". Cluedo was the original name of the game, introduced in 1949 by the famous British board game manufacturer, Waddingtons. There are cute differences between the US and UK versions. For example, the man who is murdered is called Dr. Black (Mr. Boddy in the US), one of the suspects is the Reverend Green (Mr. Green in the US), and the suspect weapons include a dagger (a knife in the US), a lead pipe (lead piping in the US) and a spanner (a wrench in the US). I think it's a fabulous game, a must during the holidays ..."
NY_D,"NYPD.    	The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the largest municipal police force in the country. The department's roots go back as far at 1625 when there was an eight-man night watch in the days when New York was still known as New Amsterdam. Several disparate forces with policing responsibility were amalgamated in 1844 to form the New York City Police Department, signalling the end of the night watch force that had existed for over 200 years."
O_RA,"OKRA.    	Gumbo is a type of stew or soup that originated in Louisiana. The primary ingredient can be meat or fish, but to be true gumbo it must include the ""holy trinity"" of vegetables, namely celery, bell peppers and onion. Okra used to be a requirement, but this is no longer the case. In fact, okra gave the dish its name, as the vernacular name for the African vegetable is ""okingumbo""."

_NOX,"KNOX.    	James Knox Polk was the 11th US President. Polk is known as a president who delivered on promises that he made during his election campaign. He left office after serving only one term, as he had promised the voters, and then contracted cholera on a goodwill tour of the South. Polk died at only 53 years of age, the youngest age for any president to die in retirement. He also enjoyed the shortest retirement of any president, at only 103 days. I guess that's why no one keeps their campaign promises these days ..."
NT_B,"NTSB.    	The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is responsible for the investigation of major accidents involving transportation. Included in this broad definition is the transportation of fluids in pipelines. The organization is independent in that it has no ties to other government agencies or departments so that its investigations can be viewed as ""impartial"". The NTSB also earns a little money for the US as it hires out its investigation teams to countries who don't have the necessary resources available on their own soil."
_UN,HUN.    	The Huns were a nomadic people who originated in Eastern Europe in the 4th century.

BET_E,"BETTE.    	I must confess that I have a problem watching movies starring Bette Davis. I think I must have seen her play one of her more sinister roles when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares or something. So, I have never seen the 1950 classic ""All About Eve"", given that Bette Davis gets top billing. But, the title role of Eve Harrington was played by Anne Baxter, and Ms Baxter's movies I do enjoy. Coincidentally, on the epic television series ""Hotel"", when Bette Davis became ill, it was Anne Baxter who was chosen to take on her role."

His political opponents chose the Tenure of Office Act as their ""weapon"" for impeachment. The Act prevented a president from removing an appointee of a past-president without the consent of the Senate. Johnson had removed the sitting Secretary of War without consulting Congress creating the opportunity for an impeachment trial in Congress. He was acquitted though, as his opponents fell one vote shy of the majority needed. The impeachment of President Johnson was the only presidential impeachment until that of President Clinton in 1999."
K_OX,"KNOX.    	Fort Knox is actually a US Army base, but it gives its name to the adjacent facility, the United States Bullion Depository.

Most of the gold stored in that vault belongs to foreign nations and banks."
TELE_,"TELEX.    	Telex grew out of the world of the telegraph. What Telex brought to telegraphy was the ability to route messages.

_MS,"PMS.    	10 Downing Street is one of the most famous street addresses in the world, the official London residence of the British Prime Minister. Although it may not look it on television, it's a spacious pad, actually a larger house made by combining three older houses back in the 1700s. Although Number 10 has over one hundred rooms, it is mostly offices and reception rooms and the actual residence itself is quite modest. It was so modest that when Tony Blair came to power he opted to move himself and his family into the more spacious residence next door at Number 11, an apartment traditionally reserved for the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the UK equivalent of the Secretary of the Treasury). The new Prime Minister, David Cameron, seemed to like the idea, because he now lives in Number 11 as well."
