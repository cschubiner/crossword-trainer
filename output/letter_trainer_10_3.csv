He set up a new enterprise and continued to use his own name as a brand. The old company sued him for using the Horch name so a meeting was held to choose something new. Horch's young son was studying Latin in the room where the meeting was taking place.

Korbut was 17 when she appeared in the 1972 Munich Games, and had been training in a sports school since she was 8-years-old.

ST_RR,"STARR.    	Ken Starr has to be one of the most famous lawyers in recent history, due to his tenure as Independent Counsel when President Bill Clinton was in office. Starr's original brief was to investigate the suicide of White House Counsel Vince Foster as well as to continue the investigation of the Whitewater controversy in which then-Governor Clinton was accused of applying pressure to arrange an illegal loan to one of his partners in the Whitewater land deal. Famously, Starr's purview was extended to include an investigation into President Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, to determine if the President had lied under oath about his relationship with the young intern."
_TR,"LTR.    	Like so many things it seems, our paper sizes here in North America don't conform with the standards in the rest of the world. ISO standard sizes used elsewhere have some logic behind them in that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard size of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government. Prior to this, the official ""government"" letter size had been 8 by 10.5 inches."

ISO standard sizes used elsewhere have some logic behind them, in that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two, each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard sizes of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government.

They start of as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants, unlike the eggs of frogs and toads which float freely. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs.

SS_S,"SSNS.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the age of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

EF_,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."

SO_O,"SOHO.    	The Manhattan neighborhood known today as SoHo was very fashionable in the early 1900s, but as the well-heeled started to move uptown the area became very run down and poorly maintained. Noted for the number of fires that erupted in derelict buildings, SoHo earned the nickname ""Hell's Hundred Acres"". The area was then zoned for manufacturing and became home to many sweatshops. In the mid-1900s artists started to move into open loft spaces and renovating old buildings as the lofts were ideal locations in which an artist could both live and work. In 1968, artists and others organized themselves so that they could legalize their residential use of an area zoned for manufacturing.

This group called itself ""The Collective"", and one of the ""founding members"" was future Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan."
SLE_,"SLED.    	'Toboggan' came into English from the French Canadian ""tabagane"", the name for a long sled with a flat bottom. The French Canadian word is probably from the Algonquian word for a sled, ""tobakun"","
SI_,"SIM.    	""SimCity"" is a very clever computer game, in which players build and grow cities and societies by creating the conditions necessary for people (the Sims) to move in and thrive. ""SimCity"" first came out in 1989, and to this day is consistently ranked as one of the greatest computer games of all time."
RO_,"ROM.    	Romania sits just east of Hungary and north of Bulgaria in Europe. Romania was formed from the union of two principalities in 1859, Moldavia and Wallachia. The Kingdom of Romania grew larger in size after WWI with the addition of three new regions, including the ""vampirish"" Transylvania. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the nation developed stronger ties with the West. Romania joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007."
_TEM,"ITEM.    	An unmarried couple known to be involved with each other might appear in the gossip columns. This appearance as ""an item"" in the papers, led to the use of ""item"" to refer to such a couple, but only since the very early seventies."
OS_,"OSU.    	I think the rivalry here is the Big Ten football rivalry between Nebraska and Ohio State University, but I could be wrong ..."
D_E,"DIE.    	The verb phrase 'to peter out', meaning 'to fizzle out', originated in the 1840s in the American mining industry. While the exact etymology isn't clear, it probably derives from the term 'saltpetre', a constituent of gunpowder."
_EL,"DEL.    	Del Mar translates into English as 'of the sea' aptly enough. Also aptly enough, this upscale beach town started out as a purpose-built resort developed for the rich and famous, back in 1885. Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball had a house there for many years, as did Burt Bacharach. Skateboarder Tony Hawks grew up in Del Mar."
ARK_,"ARKS.    	The term 'ark', when used with reference to Noah, is a translation of the Hebrew word 'tebah'. The word 'tebah' is also used in the Bible for the basket in which Moses was placed by his mother when she floated him down the Nile. It seems that the word 'tebah' doesn't mean 'boat' and nor does it mean 'basket'. Rather, a more appropriate translation is 'life-preserver' or 'life-saver'. So, Noah's ark was Noah's life-preserver during the flood."
ANO_E,"ANODE.    	Thermionic tube is another name for a vacuum tube, something we used to come across in old radios and televisions. The tube consists of two electrodes (an anode and cathode) encased in a vacuum in a sealed glass tube. The anode can be heated, just like a light-bulb, and will give off electrons, and so is said to be thermionic."
_FT,EFT.    	Electronic funds transfer (EFT)

_ON,"LON.    	Lon Chaney, Sr. played a lot of crazed-looking characters in the days of silent movies. He did much of his own make-up work, developing the grotesque appearances that became his trademark, and earning himself the nickname ""the man of a thousand faces"". Most famous were his portrayals of the title characters in the films 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1923) and ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925)."
_SP,TSP.    	Teaspoon (tsp.)
E_IAC,"ENIAC.    	The acronym ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (although many folks insist that the C was for ""Computer""). ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables, but it ended up being used early on to make calculations necessary for the development of the hydrogen bomb. Given its uses, it's not surprising to hear that development of ENIAC was funded by the US Army during WWII."
ASIA_,"ASIAN.    	The so called ""Asian Flu"" was a pandemic that originated in China in 1956, and lasted until 1958. The H2N2 virus, which caused the disease, killed an estimated 2 million people worldwide, including almost 70,000 in the US. Years later, in 1997, the financial crisis that rocked many countries across Asia was given the same name, ""Asian Flu"". The crisis started in Thailand when the Thai currency collapsed, and like a virus the panic spread across much of southeast Asia and Japan."
_OLA,"LOLA.    	""Lola"" is a fabulous song, written by Ray Davies and released by the Kinks back in 1970. Inspired by a real life incident, the lyrics tell of young man who met a young ""lady"" in a club, danced with her, and then discovered ""she"" was actually a transvestite. The storyline isn't very traditional, but the music is superb."
S_ARR,"STARR.    	Ringo Starr's real name is Richard Starkey. Before he joined the Beatles (replacing drummer Pete Best), Starkey played with the Raving Texans. It was with this band that he adopted the name ""Ringo Starr"" because he were a lot of rings, and he thought it sounded ""cowboyish"". Back then his drum solos were billed as ""Starr Time""."
IR_S,IRAS.    	Individual retirement account (IRA)

AP_A,"APIA.    	Apia is the capital city, in fact the only city, of the Pacific island-nation of Samoa. The harbor of Apia is famous for a very foolish incident in 1889 involving seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain. A typhoon was approaching so the safest thing to do was to head for open water away from land, but no nation would move its ships for fear of losing face in front of the others. Six of the vessels were lost in the typhoon as a result and 200 American and German sailors perished. The British cruiser HMS Calliope barely managed to escape from the harbor and rode out the storm safely."

E_ON,"EBON.    	Ebony is another word for the color black (often shortened to ""ebon"" in poetry). Ebony is a dark black wood that is very dense, one of the few types of wood that sinks in water. Ebony has been in high demand so the species of trees yielding the wood are now considered threatened. It is in such short supply that unscrupulous vendors have been known to darken lighter woods with shoe polish to look like ebony, so be warned ..."
_ED,"QED.    	Q.E.D. is used at the end of a mathematical proof (or a philosophical argument). The acronym stands for the Latin ""quod erat demonstrandum"" meaning ""that which was to be demonstrated""."

The ATF has its roots in the Department of Treasury dating back to 1886 when it was known as the Bureau of Prohibition. ""Explosives"" was added to the ATF's name when the bureau was moved under the Department of Justice as part of the reorganization called for in the Homeland Security Act of 2002."
DO_,"DOE.    	The US Department of Energy (DOE) came into being largely as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. The DOE was founded in 1977 by the Carter administration. The DOE is responsible for regulating the production of nuclear power, and it is also responsible for the nation's nuclear weapons. The official DOE seal features symbols denoting five sources of energy: the sun, an atom, an oil derrick, a windmill and a dynamo."
QE_,"QED.    	Q.E.D. is used at the end of a mathematical proof or a philosophical argument. The acronym stands for the Latin ""quod erat demonstrandum"" meaning ""that which was to be demonstrated""."

_ENS,"YENS.    	The word ""yen"", meaning ""urge"", has been around in English since the very early 1900s. It comes from the earlier word ""yin"" imported from Chinese, which was used in English to describe an intense craving for opium!"
WAC_,"WACO.    	In recent years, Waco is perhaps most famous as the site of a siege and shootout between ATF agents and members of the Protestant sect known as the Branch Davidians. Shortly after the ATF agents tried to execute a search warrant, shots were fired and at the end of the fight six people inside the Branch Davidian compound were dead, as were four agents. A fifty-day siege ensued at the end of which a final assault resulted in members of the community setting fire to the compound. Only nine people walked away from that fire. 50 adults and 25 children perished."
_SAKA,"OSAKA.    	The Japanese city of Osaka used to be called Naniwa, with the name changing to Osaka sometime before 1500. ""Osaka"" can be translated either as ""large hill"" or ""large slope"". Osaka is sometimes referred to as 'the Chicago of Japan' as it is a major center of commerce and industry.

Soon after, she gathered a group of admirers around her with whom she discussed philosophy and shared drafts of her magnum opus, ""Atlas Shrugged"". This group called itself ""The Collective"", and one of the founding members was none other than future Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan."

A_DI,"AUDI.    	The Audi name has an interesting history. The Horch company was founded by August Horch in 1909. Early in the life of the new company, Horch was forced out of his own business. He set up a new enterprise and continued to use his own name as a brand. The old company sued him for using the Horch name so a meeting was held to choose something new. Horch's young son was studying Latin in the room where the meeting was taking place. He pointed out that ""Horch"" was German for ""hear"" and he suggested ""Audi"" as a replacement, the Latin for ""listen""."
D_E,"DIE.    	The definite article in German is der, die or das, for masculine, feminine and neuter nouns. The indefinite article is ein, eine or ein, again depending on the gender of the noun. A further complication, relative to English, is that the masculine form (and only the masculine form) of the article changes when used in the accusative case, when used with the object of a sentence. The accusative forms are 'den' and 'einen'."
REP_,REPO.    	Repossession (repo)
_NS,RNS.    	Registered nurses (RNs) might be found in an operating room (OR) or emergency room (ER).
E_T,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world, living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants, unlike the eggs of frogs and toads which float freely. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."
EL_,"ELF.    	The three elves Snap, Crackle and Pop are the mascots for Kellogg's Rice Krispies. They first appeared in an ad campaign in 1933, although the phrase ""snap, crackle and pop"" had been used for the cereal before then in a radio ad campaign. By the way, the elves are selling ""Rice Bubbles"" in Australia, and the elves have different names in other parts of the world (like ""Cric!, Crac! and Croc! in Quebec)."
I_AS,IRAS.    	A rollover IRA is a subtype of a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA). The funds for a rollover IRA come from another qualified plan such as a 401(k) or a 403(b) account.
OLG_,"OLGA.    	Olga Korbut is from modern-day Belarus, but was born during the days of the Soviet Union. Korbut competed for the USSR team in the 1972 and 1976 Olympic Games. She was 17 when she appeared in the 1972 Munich Games, and had been training in a sports school since she was 8-years-old. The world fell in love with her as she was a very emotional young lady, readily expressing joy and disappointment, something that we weren't used to seeing in athletes from behind the Iron Curtain. Korbut immigrated to the US in 1991 and now lives in Scottsdale, Arizona."
A_ATI,"AMATI.    	The first of the family to make violins was Andrea Amati, who lived in the 14th century. He was succeeded by his sons, Antonio and Girolama.

One was his own son, Girolamo, and another, the famed Antonio Stradivari."
_AOS,"LAOS.    	The official name for the country of Laos is the Lao People's Democratic Republic. In the Lao language, the country's name is ""Meuang Lao"". The French ruled Laos as part of French Indochina, having united three separate Lao kingdoms. As there was a plural of ""Lao"" entities united into one, the French added the ""S"" and so today we tend to use ""Laos"" instead of ""Lao""."
OO_,"OOP.    	French people, and French circus acrobats in particular, use the phrase ""allez hop!"" as words of encouragement, sort of like our ""let's go!"". The phrase was anglicized to ""alley oop""."

RO_,"ROM.    	A chip or other storage device that is labeled ""ROM"" is Read Only Memory, meaning that you can't easily ""write"" information, just ""read"" it."
_AM,"HAM.    	The word ""ham"", describing a performer who overacts, is apparently a shortened form of ""hamfatter"" and dates back to the late 1800s. ""Hamfatter"" comes from a song in old minstrel shows called ""The Ham-Fat Man"". It seems that a poorly performing actor was deemed to have the ""acting"" qualities of a minstrel made up in blackface."
_AOS,"LAOS.    	The official name for the country of Laos is the Lao People's Democratic Republic. In the Lao language, the country's name is ""Meuang Lao"". The French ruled Laos as part of French Indochina, having united three separate Lao kingdoms. As there was a plural of ""Lao"" entities united into one, the French added the ""S"" and so today we tend to use ""Laos"" instead of ""Lao""."
C_L,"CAL.    	The California Golden Bears are the athletic teams of the University of California, Berkeley. The University of California, Berkeley (Cal) is the most difficult public university to get into in the world. It opened in 1869 and is named for Anglo-Irish philosopher George Berkeley."
_RLES,"ARLES.    	Quite a few years ago now, I had the privilege of living just a short car-ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although Arles has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design. Arles has a spectacular Roman amphitheater, arch, circus as well as old walls that surround the center of the city. In more modern times, it was a place Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Cafe Terrace at Night"", as well as ""Bedroom in Arles""."
_BON,"EBON.    	Ebony is another word for the color black (often shortened to ""ebon"" in poetry). Ebony is a dark black wood that is very dense, one of the few types of wood that sinks in water. Ebony has been in high demand so the species of trees yielding the wood are now considered threatened. It is in such short supply that unscrupulous vendors have been known to darken lighter woods with shoe polish to look like ebony, so be warned ..."

Dahl became one of the most successful authors of the twentieth century, and a couple of his most famous titles are ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""."
UT_,"UTA.    	Uta Hagen was a German-born American actress. She married Jose Ferrer in 1938, but were divorced ten years later after it was revealed that she was having a long-running affair with Paul Robeson. Her association with Robeson, a prominent civil rights activist, earned her a spot on the Hollywood Blacklist during the McCarthy Era. This forced her away from film, and towards a successful stage career in New York City."
OI_,"OIL.    	Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil"" was published in 1927. You might have seen the screen adaptation that was released in 2007, under the title ""There Will Be Blood"" starring Daniel Day-Lewis."
RP_,"RPM.    	The first standard for the rotational speed of gramophone records was 78 rpm. Like so many things it seems, the US version of ""78"" was slightly different from that for the rest of the world. The US record was designed to play at 78.26 rpm, whereas the standard in the rest of the world was 77.92 rpm. So, imported records playing on American equipment didn't sound quite as they were intended."
_RICA,"ERICA.    	The author Erica Jong's most famous work is her first: 'Fear of Flying', a novel published in 1973. Over twenty years later she wrote 'Fear of Fifty: a midlife memoir', published in 1994."
OMO_,"OMOO.    	Herman Melville mined his own experiences when writing his novels. Melville sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1841 on a whaler heading into the Pacific Ocean (a source for ""Moby Dick""). Melville ended up deserting his ship 18 months later and lived with natives on a South Pacific Island for three weeks (a source for ""Typee""). He picked up another whaler and headed for Hawaii, where he joined the crew of a US navy frigate headed for Boston (a source for ""Omoo"")."

Today, the NYSE is located in National Historic Landmark building with the address 11 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, New York City."
A_DI,"AUDI.    	The Audi name has an interesting history. The Horch company was founded by August Horch in 1909, but soon after, Horch was forced out of his own business. He set up a new company and continued to use his own name as a brand. The old company sued him for using the Horch name so a meeting was held to choose something new. Horch's young son was studying Latin in the room where the meeting was taking place. He pointed out that ""Horch"" was German for ""hear"", and he suggested ""Audi"" instead, the Latin for ""listen"". Don't hear ... just listen ..."
GS_,"GSA.    	The US Government's General Services Administration (GSA), as the name suggests, provides general services to other federal agencies. So for example, the GSA manages office space for the other agencies, and transportation."
A_FA,"ALFA.    	The Alfa in Alfa Romeo is actually an acronym, standing for Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili, a company founded in 1909. The company was taken over by Nicola Romeo in 1915, and in 1920 the name was changed to Alfa Romeo."
