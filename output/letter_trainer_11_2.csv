When a connection (wire, say) is made between the cathode and anode, electrons flow through the resulting circuit from the anode to cathode in an attempt to rectify the electron imbalance."

NIK_,"NIKE.    	I remember seeing Carolyn Davidson on the television show ""I've Got a Secret"". She created the Nike ""swoosh"" back in 1971 when she was a design student at Portland State. She did it as freelance work for Blue Ribbon Sports, a local company introducing a new line of athletic footwear. The ""swoosh"" is taken from the wing of the Greek goddess of victory, Nike. Years later, BRS changed its name to Nike, so I suppose the company should be grateful to Carolyn for both the great design, and a great company name."

Way back in 1974, the lovely Miss Olin was crowned Miss Scandinavia in a beauty pageant for Nordic women held in Helsinki, Finland."
CP_,"CPR.    	Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has for decades involved the simultaneous compression of the chest to pump blood using the heart, and artificial respiration by blowing air into the lungs.

""30 Rock"" is the address of the NBC studios, located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. I was shocked to read that Tina Fey has a scar on her face, a few inches long on her left cheek, the result of a childhood ""slashing"" incident. When she was just five years old, playing in the front yard of her house, someone just came up to her and slashed her with a knife. How despicable!"

_SLAN,"ASLAN.    	In the C. S. Lewis books, Aslan is the name of the lion character (as in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe""). Aslan is actually the Turkish word for lion.

M_IR,"MEIR.    	Golda Meir was known as the ""Iron Lady"" when she was Prime Minister of Israel, long before the term came to be associated with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

As a teenager she relocated to Denver where she met and married Morris Meyerson, at the age of 19. She and her husband joined a kibbutz in Palestine in 1921, when she was in her twenties. Meir had been active in politics in the US, and continued her political work in Palestine. She was very influential during WWII, and played a leading role in negotiations after the war leading to the setting up of the state of Israel. By the time she was called on to lead the country, Meir had already retired, citing exhaustion and ill health.

ENO_A,"ENOLA.    	""Waterworld"", a Kevin Costner vehicle released in 1995, really wasn't that great a movie despite it's promising storyline about land submerged by melting polar ice caps. The movie was filmed in Hawaii, a massive production with a huge budget overrun. I went SCUBA diving in one of the locations a few years after the filmcrews had headed home. All along the reef there were small metal plates embedded in the rock, used as anchor points for various floating sets. I would have thought that kind of thing would have been cleaned up, but no ..."
