When automobile travel started to become significant, Rand and McNally turned their attention to roads and they published their first road map, of New York City in 1904.

GENI_,"GENIE.    	The Disney animated feature ""Aladdin"" was released in 1992 and is one of the best features to come out of the studio, in my opinion, largely due to the great performance by Robin Williams who voiced the Genie.

""Gulliver's Travels"" is well known for its satirical references to real life, and indeed these two islands are poorly disguised satires of Britain (Lilliput) and France (Blefuscu). The two islands were at war, as was constantly the situation with Britain and France."

_HOU,"THOU.    	Benjamin Franklin is featured on one side of the hundred-dollar bill, and Philadelphia's Independence Hall on the other side. There is a famous ""error"" in the image of Independence Hall.

However, on the actual clock on Independence Hall, the ""four"" is denoted by ""IIII""."

A real favorite of mine, it stars Audrey Hepburn in the title role, opposite Humphrey Bogart in an unusual role for him. William Holden plays the inevitable second love interest.

'Sabrina was remade in 1995 in a version that's almost as good as the original, starring Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear."
_VEL,"EVEL.    	Daredevil Evel Knievel contracted hepatitis C from the many blood transfusions that he needed after injuries incurred during stunts. He had to have a liver transplant as a result, but his health declined after that. Knievel eventually passed away in 2007."

The WPA employed millions of people during the Depression, putting them to work on various public works projects. The total spending through the WPA from 1936 to 1939 was nearly $7 billion.

The result is a collection of 'New Deal Art', including a series of murals that can be found in post offices around the country to this day."

Hendrix was from Seattle and didn't really have a really stellar start to his working life. He failed to finish high school and fell foul of the law by getting caught in stolen cars, twice. The courts gave him the option of the army or two years in prison. Hendrix chose the former and soon found himself in the famous 101st Airborne. In the army, his less-than-disciplined ways helped him (as he would have seen it) because his superiors successfully petitioned to get him discharged after serving only one year of his two-year requirement, just to get him out of their hair."
I_E,"I ME.    	""I Me Mine"" is one of the relatively few Beatles songs to have been written by George Harrison (and indeed performed by him). Harrison chose the same title for his autobiography, published in 1980 just a few weeks before John Lennon was assassinated in New York City."

It served the purpose of raising the pillows, perhaps as an aid for sitting up in bed. Our modern usage of the verb ""bolster"", meaning to give a metaphoric shot in the arm, derives from this ""bolster"" that we used to sit up against."
PAOL_,"PAOLO.    	Paolo Veronese was a Renaissance painter from the Italian city of Verona (hence his name 'Veronese').

_OWAN,"IOWAN.    	The city of Des Moines is the capital of Iowa, and takes its name from the Des Moines River. The river in turn takes its name from the French ""Riviere des Moines"" meaning ""River of the Monks"". It looks like there isn't any ""monkish"" connection to the city's name per se. ""Des Moines"" was just the name given by French traders who corrupted ""Moingona"", the name of a group of Illinois Native Americans who lived by the river. However, others do contend that French Trappist monks, who lived a full 200 miles from the river, somehow influenced the name."
