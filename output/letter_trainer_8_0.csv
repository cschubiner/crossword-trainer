S_AT,"STAT.    	The exact etymology of ""stat"", used to mean ""immediately"" in the medical profession, seems to have been lost in the mists of time.

A blog reader has helpfully suggested that the term may also come from the world of laboratory analysis, where the acronym STAT stands for ""short turn around time""."
ANT_,"ANTE.    	'To pony up' means 'to pay'. Apparently the term originated as slang use of the Latin term 'legem pone' that was once used for 'money'. 'Legem Pone' was the title of the Psalm that was read out on March 25 each year, and March 25 was the first payday of the year in days gone by."

'Entourage' is the story of a young movie star from New York City learning about life in Los Angeles. The show is co-produced by the actor Mark Wahlberg and so the storyline is somewhat biographical, based on a few of Wahlberg's own experiences."

London has been a major settlement for over 2,000 years and was founded as a town by the Romans who called it Londinium. The name ""Londinium"" may have existed prior to the arrival by the Romans, and no one seems too sure of its origins. Famously, the City of London is a one-square-mile area at the center of the metropolis, the area that marked the old medieval London. ""The City"", as it is commonly called, has its own Mayor of the City of London (the Mayor of London is someone else), and it's own City of London Police Force (the London Metropolitan Police are the police we usually see on the street as tourist, a different force)."

The process is reversible, so the cartridge can be ""back-washed"" and reused."

I_E,"IRE.    	The terms 'United Kingdom', 'Great Britain' and 'England' can sometimes be confused. The official use of 'United Kingdom' originated in 1707 with the Acts of Union that declared the countries of England and Scotland as 'United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain'. The name changed again with the Acts of Union 1800 that created the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland' (much to the chagrin of most of the Irish population). This was partially reversed in 1927 when the current name was introduced, the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland', in recognition of an independent Irish Free State in the south of the island of Ireland.

In 1899 the two sons partnered with a locksmith and started to make cars, but not very successfully.

When these Irish people reached the US it was common for them to give their point of origin as 'Cork', whereas they may have come from almost anywhere in the country.

_DO,"ADO.    	""Much Ado About Nothing"" is a favorite of mine, a play by William Shakespeare. It is a comedic tale of two pairs of lovers with lots of mistaken identities and double meanings.

Such a performance was somewhat ironic, given that in Shakespeare's day the practice was to use an all-male cast."

In 1899 the two sons partnered with a locksmith and started to make cars, but not very successfully. Two years later, the locksmith was dropped in favor of a licensing arrangement with a French car company. By 1914, Opel was the largest manufacturer of automobiles in Germany.
