At the site there is a constant flow of tar that seeps up to the surface from underground, a phenomenon that has been around for tens of thousands of years.

Over many, many centuries animals came to the water to drink and became trapped in the tar as they entered the water to quench their thirsts. The tar then preserved the bones of the dead animals. Today a museum is located right by the Tar Pits, recovering bones and displaying specimens of the animals found there. It's well worth a visit if you are in town ..."

ARALS_A,"ARAL SEA.    	The Aral Sea is a great example of how man can have a devastating effect on his environment. In the early sixties the Aral Sea covered 68,000 square miles of Central Asia. Soviet Union irrigation projects drained the lake to such an extent that today the total area is less than 7,000 square miles, with 90% of the lake now completely dry. Sad ..."
S_AT,"SLAT.    	In an airplane wing, a slat is a moving surface on the leading edge of the wing, primarily having the same effect as the flap on the trailing edge. With slats and flaps deployed, a plane can fly more slowly, and take off or land in a shorter distance."

EL_AS,"ELIAS.    	Novelist Elias Canetti didn't actually settle in England until he was in his thirties. He was a native of Bulgaria, and as a child also lived in England, Austria, Switzerland and Germany. He wrote in German, even though he spent much of his working life in England, eventually adopting British citizenship. Even then, he spent the last twenty years of his life in Switzerland. His book ""Crowds and Power"" deals with the behavior of people in crowds and mobs, and the effect of vocal leaders on ""packs"". Scary stuff, I would say ..."
FERM_,"FERMI.    	The physicist Enrico Fermi was born in Rome, Italy. Fermi moved to the US just before WWII, largely to escape the anti-Semitic feelings that were developing in Italy under Mussolini. It was Fermi's work at the University of Chicago that led to the construction of the world's first nuclear reactor. Fermi died at 53 years of age from stomach cancer. Cancer was a prevalent cause of death among the team working on that first nuclear pile. The synthetic element Fermium was discovered in 1952 and is named in his honor."
JA_,"JAG.    	Jaguar started out as a manufacturer of sidecars for motorcycles back in 1922, when the company was known as the Swallow Sidecar Company (SS for short). The company changed its name to Jaguar after WWII, because of the unfortunate connotations of the letters ""SS"" at that time."

CADR_,"CADRE.    	A ""cadre"" is most commonly a group of experienced personnel at the core of a larger organization that the small group trains or heavily influences. ""Cadre"" is a French word meaning a ""frame"". We use it in the sense that a cadre is a group that provides a ""framework"" for the larger organization."
S_EVE,"STEVE.    	Steve Jobs certainly is a business icon in Silicon Valley. I don't think it is too surprising to learn that Jobs didn't finish his college education, dropping out of Reed College in Oregon after only one semester."
OP_DS,"OP-EDS.    	Op-ed is an abbreviation of ""opposite the editorial page"". Op-eds started in ""The New York Evening World"" in 1921. The page opposite the editorials was used for articles written by a named guest writer, someone independent from the editorial board."

D_C,"DEC.    	December is the twelfth month in our calendar but was the tenth month in the old Roman calendar, hence the name 'Dec-ember'. Back then there were only ten months in the year. 'Ianuarius' (January) and 'Februarius' were then added as the eleventh and twelfth months of the year. Soon after, the year was reset and January and February became the first and second months."
R_ES,"ROES.    	'Caviar' is the roe of a large fish that has been salted and seasoned, and especially the roe of a sturgeon. Beluga caviar comes from the beluga sturgeon, found primarily in the Caspian Sea.

Denali's summit stands at 20,237 feet, making it the highest mountain peak in North America. I was surprised to learn that there is a Denali State Park, as well as the Denali National Park. The two are located adjacent to each other (which makes sense!). The State Park is undeveloped for all practical purposes, with just a few campgrounds and trailheads."
BR_A,"BREA.    	The La Brea Tar Pits are located right in the heart of the city of Los Angeles. At the site there is a constant flow of tar that seeps up to the surface from underground, a phenomenon that has been around for tens of thousands of years. What is significant is that much of the seeping tar is covered by water. Over many, many centuries animals came to the water to drink and became trapped in the tar as they entered the water to quench their thirsts. The tar then preserved the bones of the dead animals. Today a museum is located right by the Tar Pits, recovering bones and displaying specimens of the animals found there. It's well worth a visit if you are in town ..."

S_EAD,"SNEAD.    	Sam Snead was probably the most successful golfer never to win a US Open title, as he won a record 82 PGA Tour events. Snead did win seven majors, but never the US Open.

EV_R,EVER.    	... and they all lived happily ever after.
EA_LS,"EARLS.    	In the ranking of nobles, an earl comes above a viscount and below a marquess.

OKR_,"OKRA.    	The great explorer Verrazzano gave the name ""Arcadia"" to the coastal land that stretched from north of present day Virginia right up the North American continent to Nova Scotia. The name Arcadia was chosen as it was also the name for a part of Greece that had been viewed as idyllic from the days of classical antiquity. The ""Arcadia"" name quickly evolved into the word ""Acadia"" that was used locally here in North America. Much of Acadia was settled by the French in the 1600s, and then in 1710 Acadia was conquered by the British. There followed the French and Indian War after which there was a mass migration of French Acadians, often via the French colony of Saint-Dominique (present-day Haiti) to the French colony of Louisiana. The local dialectic pronunciation of the word ""Acadian"" was ""Cajun"", giving the name to the ethnic group for which Louisiana has been home for about 300 years."
KA_E,"KATE.    	""Kiss Me, Kate"" is a musical written by Cole Porter first produced on Broadway in 1948. Cole Porter had a string of successes in the twenties and thirties including ""Gay Divorce"" and ""Anything Goes"", but he found his career in decline in the forties. ""Kiss Me, Kate"" proved to be a dramatic come back, and was the only one of his shows that ran for more than 1,000 performances on Broadway."
CO_ET,"COMET.    	Comets and asteroids are similar, both being relatively small celestial bodies orbiting the sun.

The coma and tail are temporary fuzzy atmospheres that develop due to the presence of solar radiation."

O_SIS,"OASIS.    	Mecca is in the Makkah province of Saudi Arabia and is the holiest city in Islam. Every year several million Muslims perform the Hajj, a holy pilgrimage to Mecca."
M_SS,"MASS.    	Newton's second law of motion tells us that a body accelerates when a force is applied to it, and the greater the mass of the object, the greater the force required to cause that acceleration. Mathematically, the law can be written as Force = mass x acceleration (F=ma)."

For example, playing Omar Bradley in 'Patton', he address a soldier with 'Hand me that helmet, Sekulovich'. Playing a prison warden in 'Birdman of Alcatraz' he includes 'Sekulovich' in a rollcall of inmates. And then in the seventies cop show 'The Streets of San Francisco', Malden's character Mike Stone employed a legman named Sekulovich."
E_NS,"ERNS.    	The ern (also erne) is also called the white-tailed eagle, and the sea-eagle."

For example, the lira (plural 'lire') was the official currency of Italy before the country changed over to the euro in 2002."
HOY_,"HOYA.    	The athletic teams of Georgetown University are known as the Hoyas. The name is derived from ""Hoya Saxa"", a traditional cheer yelled out at Georgetown games as far back as 1893.

YUL_,"YULE.    	""Yule"" celebrations coincide with Christmas, and the words ""Christmas"" and ""Yule"" have become synonymous in much of the world. However, Yule was originally a pagan festival celebrated by Germanic peoples. The name ""Yule"" comes from the Old Norse word ""jol"" that was used to describe the festival."
PE_OE,"PEKOE.    	A pekoe (or more commonly, orange pekoe) is a medium-grade black tea. There is no orange flavor in an orange pekoe tea. The 'orange' name most likely derived from the name of the trading company that brought the tea to Europe from Asia."

RO_E,"ROPE.    	Clue is another board game that we knew under a different name growing up in Ireland, as outside the US Clue is marketed as ""Cluedo"". Cluedo was introduced in 1949 by the famous British board game manufacturer, Waddingtons. There are cute differences between the US and UK versions. For example, the man who is murdered is called Dr. Black (Mr. Boddy in the US), one of the suspects is the Reverend Green (Mr. Green in the US), the weapons are a dagger (a knife in the US), a lead pipe (lead piping in the US) and a spanner (a wrench in the US). I think it's a fabulous game, a must during the holidays."
STE_E,"STEVE.    	I didn't see ""All About Steve"" as I heard it wasn't great. I might rent it though one day, as I usually enjoy Sandra Bullock vehicles. One thing we crossword fans might note though, Sandra Bullock plays a crossword puzzle writer. So, it can't be all bad! The title ""All About Steve"" is a pun on the classic 1950 film ""All About Eve"" starring Bette Davis."
BA_A,"BABA.    	Rum baba (also 'baba au rhum' in French) is a small yeast cake saturated in rum, and sometimes filled with whipped cream. Rum baba is derived from the recipe for the tall ""babka"" yeast cake that was introduced to the world by the Polish communities.

S_H,SCH.    	School (sch.)
PA_DA,"PANDA.    	Taxonomic classification of the giant panda has been a subject of great debate for years, the main question being whether it belongs to the bear or raccoon family. The accepted opinion these days, based on molecular studies, seems to be that the panda is in fact a true bear."

In 1969, the Oral-B was the first toothbrush to get to the moon as it was the toothbrush of choice for the crew of the Apollo 11 spacecraft."
T_MALE,"TAMALE.    	Hot Tamales are a cinnamon candy made by Just Born. They look like red versions of the other Just Born candy, Mike and Ike. That's no coincidence, as Hot Tamales were developed as a way to make use of rejected Mike and Ike candy. The dark red color and intense cinnamon flavor was added to the Mike and Ike rejects, masking the original flavor and color."
ST_VE,"STEVE.    	Apparently Steve McQueen wasn't the easiest actor to work with, at least as far as directors were concerned. He pretty much had a free rein though, as he was so popular with the public in the seventies (he had the nickname 'The King of Cool'). McQueen was the highest paid movie star in 1974."
A_EMIA,"ANEMIA.    	The term 'anemia' (or 'anaemia' as we write it back in Ireland) comes from a Greek word meaning ""lack of blood"". Anemia is a lack of iron in the blood, or a low red blood cell count. Tiredness is a symptom of the condition."

He was a controversial character, even during his own lifetime. One view that he held was the works attributed to William Shakespeare were not actually written by him, but rather by someone else, or perhaps a group of people."
_NTR,"ENTR.    	The term entr'acte comes to us from French, and is the interval between two acts (""entre"" deux ""actes"") of a theatrical performance. It often describes some entertainment provided during that interval."
_IO,"BIO.    	I get quite a kick out of reading the bios in ""Playbill"" as some of them can be really goofy and entertaining. ""Playbill"" started off in 1884 in New York as an in-house publication for just one theater on 21st St. You can't see any decent-sized production these days anywhere in the United States without being handed a copy of ""Playbill""."
S_IRO,"SPIRO.    	Spiro Agnew served as Vice-President under Richard Nixon, before becoming the only VP in American history to resign because of criminal charges (there was a bribery scandal).

_ID,"CID.    	Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar was known as El Cid Campeador, which translates as ""The Champion"" or perhaps ""The Lord, Master of Military Arts"". El Cid was a soldier who fought under the rule of King Alfonso VI of Spain (among others). However, he was sent into exile by the King in 1080, after acting beyond his authorization in battle. El Cid then offered his services to his former foes, the Moorish kings, After a number of years building a reputation with the Moors, he was recalled from exile by Alfonso. By this time El Cid was very much his own man. Nominally under the orders of Alfonso, he led a combined army of Spanish and Moorish troops and took the city of Valencia on the Mediterranean coast, making it is headquarters and home. He died there, quite peacefully in 1099."
EVE_,"EVER.    	The Lord's Prayer is a central prayer in Christian religions, and is found in two places in the New Testament. In the version in the Gospel of Matthew the last line of the prayer is ""deliver from evil"". In the Gospel of Luke the last line is ""lead us not into temptation"". The last words of the prayer as it most often said today are:"

Soon after the purchase was made, the newly acquired land was split into the Orleans Territory, lands south of the 33rd parallel (and today&#8217;s southern border of Arkansas), and the Louisiana Territory, which was the land in the purchase north of the 33rd parallel. The Louisiana Territory stretched northwards as far as the Great Lakes, and the seat of government was chosen as the city of St. Louis. Just to confuse everyone (such as&nbsp;foreigners&nbsp;like me), the Orleans Territory was admitted to the Union in 1812 as the State of Louisiana. At the same time, in a measure designed to prevent confusion, the Louisiana Territory was renamed, to the Territory of Missouri."
ST_,STD.    	Pacific Standard Time (PST).
N_S,"NUS.    	The Latin equivalent of the Greek letter nu is ""N"". An uppercase nu looks just like the Latin capital N, however, the lowercase nu looks like our lowercase ""v"". Very confusing ..."
GA_,"GAD.    	""To gad about"" is to move around with little purpose. The word comes from the Middle English ""gadden"" meaning ""to hurry""."
M_M,"MOM.    	The full expression is, ""As American as motherhood and apple pie"". I think the concept here is not that America is the home of motherhood or apple pie, but rather that America is as wholesome as motherhood and apple pie. I've heard that the phrase originated in WWII when GI's when interviewed by journalists would say that they were going to war ""for Mom and apple pie""."
E_OC,EEOC.    	Equal Opportunity Employment is a term that has been around since 1964 when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was set up by the Civil Rights Act.
M_T,"MST.    	Local solar time was replaced with standard time zones with the increasing use of rail travel and telecommunications, as the variations in local solar times became very inconvenient. Time zones in the US vary in hourly increments, but in some parts of the world a 30-minute or even 15-minute difference can apply."
T_AMO,"TE AMO.    	A ""telenovela"" is a ""television novel"", a form of programming that is very popular in Latin America. It is sort of like a soap opera that has an end in sight, that runs for less than a year. I like this quote from an executive at Telemundo:"
LEG_S,"LEGOS.    	There are currently six Legoland theme parks in the world, with two here in North America. One of the US parks is in Winter Haven, Florida and the other is in Carlsbad, California (which is the one that I've visited ... a fun place)."
_ANE,"DANE.    	The full title of William Shakespeare's play that we tend to call ""Hamlet"" is ""The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark"". It is the most performed of all Shakespeare's plays and it is also his longest, comprising a full five acts."
TER_,"TERR.    	In the Louisiana Purchase the US government bought French Louisiana from France. Soon after the purchase was made, the newly acquired land was split into the Orleans Territory, lands south of the 33rd parallel (and today's southern border of Arkansas), and the Louisiana Territory, which was the land in the purchase north of the 33rd parallel. The Louisiana Territory stretched northwards as far as the Great Lakes, and the seat of government was chosen as the city of St. Louis. Just to confuse everyone (such as foreigners like me), the Orleans Territory was admitted to the Union in 1812 as the State of Louisiana. At the same time, in a measure designed to prevent confusion, the Louisiana Territory was renamed, to the Territory of Missouri."

An MRI on the other hand (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), uses powerful magnetic fields to generate its images so there is no exposure to ionizing radiation (such as X-rays).

The primary ingredient can be meat or fish, but to be true gumbo it must include the ""holy trinity"" of vegetables, namely celery, bell peppers and onion.

UMA_I,"UMAMI.    	Umami is one of the five basic tastes, along with sweet, sour, bitter and salty. 'Umami' is a Japanese word used to describe ""a pleasant savory taste'.

Seiko was chosen as the official time keeper for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and was asked to supply a timer that produced a printed record. This request brought Seiko into the business of printer production. The company developed the world's first mini-printer for the Games and called it EP-101 (EP standing for Electronic Printer).

Instead of having to talk to an operator to route a particular message to the intended party, the user of a telex could route the message directly to another telex machine by way of a rotary dial, very similar to that on a telephone."
_ILAS,"SILAS.    	""Silas Marner: The Weaver of Raveloe"" is a novel written by George Eliot and first published in 1861.

_ANDE,"A AND E.    	The A&E television network used to be a favorite of mine, with the ""A&E"" standing for ""arts and entertainment"".

_EF,"REF.    	We never used the word ""gridiron"" when I was growing up in Ireland (meaning a grill used for cooking food over an open fire). So, maybe I am excused for finding out relatively recently that a football field gridiron is so called because the layout of yard lines over the field looks like a gridiron used in cooking!"
LO_EN,"LOREN.    	Sophia Loren certainly has earned her place in the world of movies. In 1962 she won an Oscar for Best Actress for her role in the Italian film ""Two Women"", the first actress to win an Academy Award for a non-English speaking performance.

N_S,"NTS.    	Windows XP, Windows Vista and now Windows 7; they're all based on the Windows NT operating system. There is a common perception that Windows NT (WNT) takes its name from VMS, an earlier operating system developed by Digital Equipment Corporation. ""WNT"" is what's called a ""Caesar cypher"" of ""VMS"", as you just augment the the letters of VMS alphabetically by one to arrive at WNT.
