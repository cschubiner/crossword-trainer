DE_BY,"DERBY.    	I think a bowler hat is usually called a derby here in the US. The bowler was first produced in 1849 in London by hatmakers Thomas and William Bowler, hence the name. The alternative name of ""derby"" comes from the tradition of wearing bowler hats at the Derby horse race (a major race held annually in England)."

OZ_,"OZS.    	The unit of mass that we know today as a 'pound' is descended from the old Roman unit of weight known as a 'libra'. That 'libra' connection is why we abbreviate 'pound' to 'lb'.

_OTHS,"MOTHS.    	The larvae of several types of moth are noted for eating fabrics made from natural fibers such as wool or cotton. Many people store woolens in cedar chests believing that the scent of the wood prevents a moth infestation.

One way to kill moth larvae in fabric is to freeze the garment for several days at a temperature below 8 degrees centigrade."
AZALE_,"AZALEA.    	Azaleas are very toxic to horses, sheep and goats, but strangely enough cause no problem for cats or dogs. And if you go to Korea you might come across ""Tug Yonju"", which is azalea wine made from the plant's blossoms."

Kmart is famous for its promotions known as 'blue light specials', a program first introduced in 1965 and discontinued in 1991. I remember being in a Kmart store soon after coming to live in the US. That evening an employee installed a light stand an aisle away from me, switched on a flashing blue light and there was some unintelligible announcement over the loudspeaker system. I had no idea what was going on ..."
_EDICI,"MEDICI.    	The House of Medici was a dynasty from the the Italian Republic of Florence. The Medici family went into the world of finance and built the largest bank in Europe in the 15th century.

Joe figure, but, more famous than all of them I would say is the 1997 movie 'G.I. Jane' starring Demi Moore in the title role. I thought that 'G.I. Jane' had some potential, to be honest, but it really did not deliver in the end."
MC_N,"MCAN.    	Thom McAn footwear was introduced in 1922 by the Melville Corporation (now CVS Caremark). The brand was named after a Scottish golfer called Thomas McCann. The Thom McAn line is epitomized by the comfortable leather casual and dress shoe, so sales have really been hurt in recent decades by the growing popularity of sneakers."

Y_YO,"YO-YO.    	Would you believe that the first yo-yos date back to 500 BC? There is even an ancient Greek vase painting that shows a young man playing with a yo-yo. Centuries later Filipinos were using yo-yos as hunting tools in the 1500s. ""Yo-yo"" is a Tagalog (Filipino) word meaning ""come-come"" or simply ""return""."
_AWN,"PAWN.    	I remember the bad old days growing up in Dublin, Ireland, when my mother had to go to the pawn shop (I hope she doesn't read this!).

""Zelig"" tells the fictitious story, in documentary style, of Leonard Zelig (played by Allen) who has the gift of being able to change his appearance in order to better fit in with the company he keeps.

The Ark was built according to instructions given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. The tablets that were preserved were actually copies, as Moses smashed the originals given to him by God. Moses did so in a fit of anger when when he saw his people worshiping the Golden Calf."
