In the seventies, astronomers began to discover more large objects in the solar system, including Eris, a ""scattered disc object"" at the outer reaches. Given that Eris is actually bigger than Pluto, and other objects really aren't that much smaller, Pluto's status as a planet was drawn into question.

""Djinns"" were various spirits considered lesser than angels, with people exhibiting unsavory characteristics said to be possessed by djinn. When the book ""The Thousand and One Nights"" was translated into French, the word ""djinn"" was transformed into the existing word ""génie"", because of the similarity in sound and the related spiritual meaning. This ""génie"" from the Arabian tale became confused with the Latin-derived ""genius"", a guardian spirit thought to be assigned to each person at birth.

_OM,"COM.    	A domain name is basically the address of a website on the Internet. Recently, I moved this website to a new address (from www.puzzle.paxient.com to www.NYTCrossword.com). Like in the real world, one pays for an address. I now own (well rent!) both of the addresses used for this blog, but choose to ""do business"", publish the blog, at the more memorable address. It's sort of like preferring to have a Park Avenue address instead of one on say Elm Street. In the Internet world, the address is intended to indicate what type of activity goes on at a particular address. So an address with "".com"" implies a ""company"" website, a "".org"" implies a non-profit website and "".edu"" implies an education website. But, in reality anyone can rent whatever address they want, as it just goes to the highest bidder. Most folks remember "".com"" addresses, so they are the most popular. "".com"" is meant to imply a ""business address"" as I say, but it can even be used to chat about crosswords!"

Both ""Hans"" and ""Jean"" translate into English as ""John"". In WWI Arp moved to Switzerland to avoid being called up to fight, taking advantage of Swiss neutrality. Eventually he was told to report to the German Consulate and fill out paperwork for the draft. In order to get out of fighting, Arp messed up the paperwork by writing the date in every blank space on the forms. Then he took off all of his clothes and walked with his papers over to the officials in charge. He was sent home ..."

CL_OPATRA,"CLEOPATRA.    	The 1963 movie ""Cleopatra"" really was an epic work. It was the highest grossing film of the year, taking in $26 million dollars at the box office, yet it still lost money. The original budget for the film was just $2 million, but so many things went wrong the final cost swelled to a staggering $44 million dollars, making it the second most expensive movie ever made (taking into account inflation). Elizabeth Taylor was supposed to earn a record amount of $1 million for the film, and ended up earned seven times that amount due to delays. But she paid dearly, as she became seriously ill during shooting and had to have an emergency tracheotomy to save her life. The scar in her throat can actually be seen in some of the shots in the film."

That would be quite an honor given that his teammates included Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig."

PO_H,"POSH.    	No one really knows the etymology of the word ""posh"". The popular myth that POSH stands for ""Port Out, Starboard Home"" is completely untrue, and is a story that can actually be traced back to the 1968 movie ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". The myth is that wealthy British passengers travelling to and from India would book cabins on the port side for the outward journey and the starboard side for the home journey. This trick was supposedly designed to keep their cabins out of the direct sunlight."
M_RC,"MERC.    	The Chicago Mercantile Exchange started its life as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board in 1898. The Merc is the site for exchange of commodities, among other things."

AM_UR,"AMOUR.    	Madame de Pompadour was the very official and well catered-to mistress of Louis XV of France. She lives on in popular culture in a number of ways, including the Pompadour hairstyle. At one time she wore her hair swept back from her forehead, but with a wave that made the front of her hair bulge forward. Her name became associated with the style, and so it remains today. The style became fashionable with so-called rockabilly artists in the later fifties, including one Elvis Presley."

_OEL,JOEL.    	The Book of Joel in the Hebrew Bible is part of the collection known as the Twelve Minor Prophets. These books are referred to as 'minor' as the texts are relatively short.
I_CAS,"INCAS.    	Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro discovered the Incas in 1526, marking the beginning of the end for an ancient civilization that was to be ravaged by brutal Spanish colonists and by imported smallpox. The last leader of the Inca was Atahualpa. Pizarro staged a mock trial and then condemned Atahualpa to execution by burning. A Spanish friar intervened on behalf of the condemned man, as Atahualpa believed that if he was burned his soul would not move on to the afterlife. Pizarro, was kind enough to have Atahualpa garroted instead."
END_,"ENDS.    	""Kibosh"" is something that constrains or checks. ""Kibosh"" looks like a Yiddish word but it isn't, and is more likely English slang from the early 1800s."
IB_,"IBN.    	In Arabic names, 'ibn' is a word meaning 'son of'. The words 'bin' and 'ben' are also used for 'son of'. The word 'bint' means 'daughter of'. Similarly, in Hebrew 'ben' is used to mean 'son of', and 'bat' is used to mean 'daughter of'."

EU_O,"EURO-.    	The 'eurozone' or 'euro area' is a monetary and economic union within the European Union of 19 states (as of today) that use the euro as a shared legal tender and their sole currency. The last nation to adopt the euro was Lithuania, in 2015."

R_GER,"ROGER.    	The term 'roger', meaning 'yes' or 'acknowledged', comes from the world of radiotelephony.

As such, it became customary to say 'Roger' when acknowledging a message, with R (Roger) standing for 'received'."
_EAK,"TEAK.    	Teak is a hardwood tree in the mint family, commonly found in monsoon forests of Asia."
_WE,"SWE.    	Sweden is the third largest country in the European Union by area.

OBIW_N,"OBI-WAN.    	Obi-Wan Kenobi is one of the more beloved of the 'Star Wars' characters. Kenobi was portrayed by two fabulous actors in the series of films. As a young man he is played by Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, and as an older man he is played by Alec Guinness."

RAN_,"RANT.    	I suppose some might say that I suffer from 'blogorrhea', a term used for excessive and compulsive blogging. That said, the term usually applies to posts with very little structure, just a continuous flow of thoughts. 'Blogorrhea' is a portmanteau of 'blog' and 'logorrhea', with the latter term describing an excessive and uncontrollable flow of words. 'Logorrhea' dates back to the mid-1800s, and combines 'logo-', meaning speech, with the ending of the word 'diarrhea'."

The album and video was recorded live in 1993 at a concert in the Herodes Atticus Theatre that was built in 161 AD on the southwest slope of the Acropolis in Athens.

RIT_,"RITE.    	A Jewish girl becomes a Bat Mitzvah at 12 years of age, the age at which she becomes responsible for her actions. Boys become Bar Mitzvahs at 13. The terms translate into English as daughter and son of the commandments."

_OILA ,VOILA!.    	'Voilà!' is French for 'there it is!'
H_LE,"HOLE.    	There's an urban myth that the standard number of holes on a golf course is 18 because it takes 18 shots to polish off a fifth of scotch whisky. However, the truth is that the standard number of holes in the Old Course at St. Andrews in Scotland happened to settle down over time at 18, and that standard was adopted all around the world."
AF_O,AFRO.    	An afro is a bushy hairdo.

The term first became public in the US when the FBI managed to turn some members of the American Mafia. The Italian authorities established that 'Cosa Nostra' was also used in Sicily when they penetrated the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s. The term 'mafia' seems to be just a literary invention that has become popular with the public.
SLAK_,"SLAKE.    	To slake' is to satisfy a craving, as in slaking one's thirst."
S_I,"SUI.    	""Sui generis"" is a Latin expression meaning ""of its own kind"". The term can be used in a number of fields, and in philosophy it refers to an idea which cannot be included in a wider concept, and idea of its own kind."

ERE_,"ERES.    	We have a big event across Europe every year called the Eurovision Song Contest. Each nation enters one song in competition with each other, and then voters across the whole continent decide on the winner. That's how ABBA got their big break when they won in 1974 with ""Waterloo"". In 1972, Spain's entry was ""Eres tu"" (the Spanish for ""You Are"") sung by the band Mocedades. ""Eres tu"" came second in the competition, but should have won in my humble opinion."
A_LEN,"ARLEN.    	Harold Arlen is a composer of popular music who will forever be associated with his composition 'Over the Rainbow' from the movie 'The Wizard of Oz'. Arlen also composed the music to 'Come Rain or Come Shine', 'It's Only a Paper Moon', 'Lydia the Tattooed Lady' and the wonderful 'Stormy Weather'."
CR_E,"CRUE.    	Mötley Crüe is an American rock band, from Los Angeles. They've been around since 1981, co-founded by the famous drummer Tommy Lee. Tommy Lee is also known for his two celebrated marriages, the first with Heather Locklear and the second with Pamela Anderson. The name 'Mötley Crüe' was chosen as someone once described the band members as a 'motley looking crew'. The spelling was made to look a little more exotic, with the umlauts added over the 'o' and 'u' one day, as the band were drinking bottles of ""Löwenbräu"" beer!"
BO_O,"BONO.    	Irish singer Bono is a Dubliner, born Paul David Hewson. As a youth, Hewson was given the nickname ""Bono Vox"" by a friend, a Latin expression meaning ""good voice"", and so the singer has been known as Bono since the late seventies. His band's first name was ""Feedback"", later changed to ""The Hype"". The band members searched for yet another name and chose U2 from a list of six names suggested by a friend. They picked U2 because it was the name they disliked least ..."

E_REKA,"EUREKA.    	Eureka translates from Greek as ""I have found it"". The word is usually associated with Archimedes, uttered as he stepped into his bath one day.

_IRE,"TIRE.    	Uniroyal is the tire brand name used by United States Rubber Company, which in turn is a subsidiary of Michelin North America."

K_PI,KEPI.    	A kepi is that circular cap with a visor that's worn in particular by the French military.
VET_,"VETO.    	""Veto"" comes directly from Latin and means ""I forbid"". The word was used by tribunes of Ancient Rome to indicate that they opposed measures passed by the Senate."
GA_P,"GARP.    	John Irving's 1978 novel ""The World According to Garp"" is somewhat biographical. In fact, Irving's mother found parts of the novel difficult to read, recognizing elements of herself in Garp's mother, Jenny Fields."
G_US,"GNUS.    	A gnu is also known as a wildebeest, an antelope native to Africa. ""Wildebeest"" is actually the Dutch word for ""wild beast""."
RH_NE,"RHINE.    	The Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in Bavaria, Germany connects the Danube and Rhine basins. The waterway is just over a hundred miles long and was completed in 1992."
AU_T,"AUNT.    	I suppose that most famously 'Arsenic and Old Lace' is a Frank Capra film, released in 1944. The movie was based on a 1939 stage play by Joseph Kesselring. The film stars Cary Grant as a completely madcap and frantic Mortimer Brewster. Grant was only the fourth choice for the role, after Bob Hope, Jack Benny and Ronald Reagan. That's quite an eclectic mix of actors ..."
RHO_,"RHOS.    	Rho is the Greek letter that looks just like our Roman letter ""p"". Rho is the symbol used for density, i.e. mass/volume."
PA_TI,"PATTI.    	Patti Smith is a singer-songwriter who was a big player in the seventies punk rock movement in New York City.

R_TSO,"RATSO.    	Enrico Salvatore 'Ratso' Rizzo is one of the characters in the groundbreaking 1969 movie 'Midnight Cowboy'. Rizzo is a down-and-out con man, played by Dustin Hoffman."

_AHARA,"SAHARA.    	The name ""Sahara"" means ""greatest desert"" in Arabic and it is just that, a great desert covering almost 4 million square miles of Northern Africa. That's almost the size of the United States."
FC_,"FCC.    	TV broadcasting is monitored by the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC has been around since 1934, when it replaced the Federal Radio Commission."
_ERO,AERO.    	I must admit to having a weakness for Aero chocolate bars. Aero was introduced by Rowntree's in the North of England in 1935. The 'aero' name is a reference to the chocolate's 'bubbly' texture.
A_PIC,"ASPIC.    	Aspic is a dish in which the main ingredients are served in a gelatin made from meat stock. ""Aspic"" is a French word for ""jelly""."
_LARE,"CLARE.    	One of my favorite counties in Ireland is Clare, home of the Burren, a beautiful, desolate landscape, as well as the world-famous Cliffs of Moher that greet the Atlantic Ocean."
OR_L,"ORAL.    	The Oral-B toothbrush was introduced to the world in 1950, designed by a California periodontist. The first ""model"" was the Oral-B 60, a name given to reflect the 60 tufts in the brush. In 1969, the Oral-B was the first toothbrush to get to the moon as it was the toothbrush of choice for the crew of the Apollo 11 spacecraft."
_AMS,"RAMS.    	Chrysler put ram hood ornaments on all of its Dodge branded vehicles starting in 1933. When the first line of Dodge trucks and vans were introduced in 1981, they were named 'Ram' in honor of that hood ornament."
RARE_AS,"RARE GAS.    	The noble gases (also 'rare gases') are those elements over on the extreme right of the Periodic Table. Because of their 'full' complement of electrons, noble gases are very unreactive. The six noble gases that occur naturally are helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon."
D_AM,"DRAM.    	The dram is a confusing unit of measurement, I think. It has one value as an ancient unit of mass, and two different values as a modern unit of mass, another value as a unit of fluid volume, and yet another, varying value as a measure of Scotch whisky!"
AU_T,"AUNT.    	Hestia was the virgin goddess of the hearth and home to ancient Greeks. She was a daughter of Cronus and Rhea, and a sibling of Zeus."
_WE,"SWE.    	The first Winter Olympic Games was held in 1924, in Chamonix, France. The Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year until 1992, after which they were staggered so that we have an Olympic Games every two years. Only one country has won a gold medal at each and every Winter Games, and that is the United States."

The company started out selling vacuum cleaners by mail, a new concept in 1963. David Oreck himself appears regularly as a spokesman in the company's ads and infomercials."
M_GOO,"MAGOO.    	Mr. Quincy Magoo is a wonderful cartoon character voiced by Jim Backus. Backus is probably equally well-known for playing Mr. Magoo as well as Thurston Howell, III on ""Gilligan's Island"". Mr. Magoo first appeared on the screen in a short called ""The Ragtime Bear"" in 1949. His persona was at least in part based on the antics of W. C. Fields. Backus originally used a fake rubber nose that pinched his nostrils in order to create the distinctive voice, although in time he learned to do the voice without the prop. My absolute favorite appearance by Mr. Magoo is in ""Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol"", a true classic from the sixties. There was a movie adaptation of ""Mr Magoo"" released in 1997, with Leslie Nielsen playing the title role."
_NXS,"INXS.    	INXS (pronounced 'in excess') was a rock band from Australia. The band formed in 1977 in Sydney as the Farriss Brothers, as three of the original lineups were indeed brothers."
C_MI,"CAMI.    	A camisole (also 'cami') is a sleeveless undergarment worn by women that extends down to the waist. ""Camisole"" is a French word that we imported into English, which ultimately derives from the Latin ""camisia"" meaning ""shirt, nightgown""."
BER_A,"BERRA.    	Yogi Berra is regarded by many as the greatest catcher ever to play in Major League Baseball, and has to be America's most celebrated ""author"" of malapropisms. Here are some greats:"
_OTEL,"HOTEL.    	Travelocity is my favorite online travel agency, although it's not the only one I use (one must shop around!). The feature I most like on Travelocity is 'Top Secret Hotels', where one can find hotel rooms at below the regular published online rates, but ... the booking is made without knowing the hotel's name. You get the general location, star-rating, facilities etc. and then 'take a chance'. I booked a room in a 4-star hotel in San Jose recently for $120 for the night, when the best online quote I could find for the same hotel was $359. We book Top Secret Hotels (usually way cheaper than that one in San Jose!) on our road trips for I'd say every second night ..."
U_CLE,"UNCLE.    	The Uncle Sam personification of the United States was first used during the War of 1812. The 'Uncle Sam' term was so widely accepted that even the Germans used it during WWII, choosing the code word ""Samland"" for ""America"" in intelligence communiques."
D_RGE,"DIRGE.    	Another clever clue. Notes played at a ""passing"" might be a funeral dirge."
TO_EY,"TOBEY.    	The actor Tobey Maguire is most associated with the role of Spider-Man these days. I'm not much into comic book hero films, but I do kind of enjoy the understated way that Maguire takes on 'Spidey'. Maguire has appeared in other hit films, like 'Pleasantville' (1998), 'The Cider House Rules' (1999) and 'Seabiscuit' (2003). Off the screen, he is big into poker and it's said that he has won over $10 million playing poker in Hollywood."
_APP,"CAPP.    	Joe Btfsplk is a character in Al Capp's ""Li'l Abner"" cartoon strip. He is the guy walking around with a black cloud over his head, a sign that he is the world's worst jinx. According to Al Capp, the name Btfsplk is a ""rude sound"", a so-called Bronx cheer."
AD_EM,"AD REM.    	The Latin term 'ad rem' translates literally as ""to the matter""."
ITE_,ITER.    	'Iter' is the Latin for 'road'.
_TL,"PTL.    	'The PTL Club' was a daily television show hosted by televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. PTL is short for both 'Praise the Lord' and 'People that Love'. The show ended its run of over ten years in 1987 when it was revealed that Jim Bakker was involvement in financial and sexual scandals. Bakker served 5 years in jail, part of an 18-year sentence."
ES_,"-EST.    	""The Guinness Book of World Records"" holds some records of its own. It is the best-selling, copyrighted series of books of all time and is one of the books most often stolen from public libraries! The book was first published in 1954 by two twins, Norris and Ross McWhirter. The McWhirter twins found themselves with a smash hit, and eventually became very famous in Britain hosting a TV show based on world records."
G_A,"GMA.    	Good Morning America' (GMA) is ABC's morning show, and has been since 1975. There was even a spinoff show called 'Good Afternoon America', although that only lasted for a few months in 2012."

SYRI_,SYRIA.    	The modern state that we know as Syria was established after WWI as a French mandate. Syria was granted independence from France in 1946.
CIT_,"CITI.    	Citi Field is the relatively new baseball stadium used by the New York Mets, and sits right next door to Shea stadium, where the Mets had played for decades. And the name of course comes from sponsor Citigroup."
HIN_I,"HINDI.    	Bollywood is the informal name given to the huge film industry based in Mumbai in India. The term 'Bollywood' is a melding of 'Bombay', the old name for Mumbai, and 'Hollywood'."
LAN_,"LANE.    	Bowling has been around for an awfully long time. The oldest known reference to the game is in Egypt, where pins and balls were found in an ancient tomb that is over 5,000 years old. The first form of the game to come to America was nine-pin bowling, which had been very popular in Europe for centuries. In 1841 in Connecticut, nine-pin bowling was banned due to its association with gambling. Supposedly, an additional pin was added to get around the ban, and ten-pin bowling was born."
