Normand was so successful off the screen that she had her own movie studio and production company in the twenties."

It was introduced in aristocratic circles at a time when it was considered very fashionable to speak French.

The term ""cul de sac"" in France is actually quite rude."

In the world of the occult, the witching hour last from 3 to 4 in the morning, and is the time at which witches and demons appear and are at their most powerful.

Back then, individuals were labelled as Type A in order to emphasize a perceived increased risk of heart disease.

_ICE,"NICE.    	The city of Nice lies on the Mediterranean coast of France, not far from the Italian border.

The center line of the DMZ is where the front was when the ceasefire came into effect in 1953 after the Korean War. According to the armistice signed, all troops had to move back 2,000 meters from the front line on both sides, creating the DMZ that is in place today. Paradoxically perhaps, the areas on either side of the DMZ form the most heavily militarized border in the world."

RAD_O,"RADIO.    	I remember my Dad buying our first transistor radio in the sixties, and what an amazing device it was. It could operate on batteries and didn't need to be plugged into the wall! Having said that, I do wish I still had that old Telefunken radio set with the valves and tubes that used to glow and take so long to warm up. In Ireland we still call a portable radio simply a ""transistor""."

O_UM,OVUM.    	The ooplasm is better known to us as the yolk of the egg.
STR_P,"STREP.    	Streptococcus bacteria multiply and divide along a single axis so that they form linked chains. That behavior gives the genus of bacteria its name, as 'streptos' is Greek for 'easily twisted, like a chain'. I had a battle with streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) recently and it was not at all pleasant, I must say. Another species of streptococcus is responsible for that terrible 'flesh-eating' infection that makes the news from time to time."
TRITO_,"TRITON.    	Triton is the largest moon of Neptune, and is named after the Greek sea god (Neptune is the Roman sea god). Triton is unique in our solar system in that it has a ""retrograde orbit"", meaning that it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction to the planet's rotation."

After the V-2, the second most-used ballistic missile in warfare is the Scud, which featured in a number of conflicts:"
C_UE,"CLUE.    	Clue is another board game that we knew under a different name growing up in Ireland, as outside of North America Clue is marketed as ""Cluedo"". Cluedo was introduced in 1949 by the famous British board game manufacturer, Waddingtons. There are cute differences between the US and UK versions. For example, the man who is murdered is called Dr. Black (Mr. Boddy in the US), one of the suspects is the Reverend Green (Mr. Green in the US), the weapons are a dagger (a knife in the US), a lead pipe (lead piping in the US) and a spanner (a wrench in the US). I think it's a fabulous game, a must during the holidays."
G_NSU,"GINSU.    	Ginsu knives are more famous for their hard-sell television ads than for their efficacy in the kitchen, I think.

AP_RT,"APORT.    	The left side of a ship used to be called the ""larboard"" side, but this was dropped in favor of ""port"" as pronunciation of ""larboard"" was easily confused with ""starboard"", the right side of the vessel.

C_LLI,"CELLI.    	Celli is the plural of ""cello""."
O_LY,"ONLY.    	CD-ROM stands for ""compact disc read only memory"". That means you can read information from the disc (like a regular music CD for example), but you can't write to it. You can buy a CD-RW, which stands for ""compact disc - rewritable"", with which you can read data and also write over it multiple times if you have the right type of CD drive."

O_EEFE,"O'KEEFE.    	Michael O'Keefe played Danny Noonan in the film ""Caddyshack"" (I'm not a big fan of that movie). I saw O'Keefe at the cinema not too long ago in the George Clooney film ""Michael Clayton""."
EHU_,"EHUD.    	Ehud Barak served as Prime Minister of Israel from 1999 to 2001. Barak left office after he called a special election for Prime Minister and lost the vote to Ariel Sharon. He resigned from the Knesset and took an advisory job with the US company Electronic Data Systems (EDS), and did some security-related work with a private equity company. In 2007, Barak took over leadership of Israel's Labor Party and is now the country's Minister of Defense."
CL_E,"CLUE.    	Clue is another board game that we knew under a different name growing up in Ireland. Outside of North America, Clue is marketed as ""Cluedo"". Cluedo was the original name of the game, introduced in 1949 by the famous British board game manufacturer Waddingtons. There are cute differences between the US and UK versions. For example, the man who is murdered is called Dr. Black (Mr. Boddy in the US), one of the suspects is the Reverend Green (Mr. Green in the US), and the suspect weapons include a dagger (a knife in the US), a lead pipe (lead piping in the US) and a spanner (a wrench in the US). I think it's a fabulous game, a must during the holidays ..."
YAMA_A,"YAMAHA.    	The Japanese company Yamaha started out way back in 1888 as a manufacturer of piano and reed organs. Even though the company has diversified since then, Yamaha's logo still reflects it musical roots. Even on Yamaha motorcycles you can see a logo made up of three intersecting tuning forks."
MAN_E,MANSE.    	A manse is a minister's home in various Christian traditions. The Latin for 'dwelling' is 'mansus'.
HI_,"HIC.    	The exact cause of hiccups (also hiccoughs) isn't really known, but they are often brought on by drinking carbonated drinks or alcohol, and eating too quickly. What physically happens is a sudden contraction of the diaphragm causing an abrupt inrush of air into the lungs. As the air rushes in, the epiglottis closes, creating the ""hic"" sound."
N_O,"NGO.    	When France withdrew from French Indochina in the mid-fifties, Ngo Dinh Diem led the movement to create the Republic of Vietnam. In what was regarded as a fraudulent referendum, the new country of Vietnam was formed, and in 1955 Diem declared himself its first president. His rule was far from peaceful, and he was assassinated by rivals in 1963."
Y_NTL,"YENTL.    	""Yentl"" is a play that opened in New York City in 1975. The move to adapt the play for the big screen was led by Barbara Streisand, and indeed she wrote the first outline of a musical version herself as far back as 1968. The film was eventually made and released in 1983, with Streisand performing the lead role."
STO_S,"STOAS.    	A stoa was a covered walkway in Ancient Greek architecture. It usually consisted of columns lining the side of a building or buildings, with another row of columns defining the other side of the walkway. The columns supported a roof. Often stoae would surround marketplaces in large cities."

BATE_,"BATES.    	When she was 33 years old, Katharine Lee Bates took a train ride from Massachusetts to Colorado Springs. She was so inspired by many of the beautiful sights she saw on her journey that she wrote a poem she called ""Pikes Peak"".

Bates's poem and Ward's tune were published together for the first time in 1910, and given the title ""America the Beautiful""."
EMBAR_O,"EMBARGO.    	An embargo differs from a blockade. An embargo is a legal prohibition of trade with a particular country, whilst a blockade is an act of war, a militarily enforced prevention of the movement of goods and services. The term ""embargo"" came into English from Spanish, in the late 16th century."
ARNE_,ARNEL.    	Arnel is a brand name of an acetate textile.

R_ES,"RUES.    	""Rue"" is the French word for ""road""."
SMO_T,"SMOOT.    	The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was sponsored by US Senator Reed Smoot and US Representative Willis C. Hawley. The act raised tariffs on imported goods to record levels, the second highest in US history. The strategy appeared to work at first, protecting US jobs in the early days of the depression. But, as many anticipated, tariffs were raised in retaliation by other countries and US exports plummeted. Many economists blame the 1930 Tariff Act for the depth of the Great Depression."
UGG_,"UGGS.    	Uggs are sheepskin boots that originated in Australia and New Zealand. Uggs have sheepskin fleece on the inside for comfort and insulation, with a tanned leather surface on the outside for durability. Ugg is a generic term 'down under', although it's a brand name here in the US."
A_RENAL,"ADRENAL.    	Cortisol is a naturally occurring chemical, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. In the body it is secreted as a response to stress or when there is low blood sugar, and its primary purpose is to increase blood sugar levels. Cortisol also has the effect of suppressing the bodies immune response. As such, the pharmaceutical form of cortisol (usually called hydrocortisone) is used to treat allergic reactions. Hydrocortisone can calm down skin irritation if applied as a cream (and usually mixed with aloe)."

EV_TE,"EVITE.    	An ""evite"" is an ""electronic invitation""."
_HARMA,"DHARMA.    	""Dharma"" can mean a number of different things in Buddhism and Hinduism.

In the context of Buddhism, dharma is the collection of teachings and doctrines of the faith."

A_C,"AKC.    	The American Kennel Club is the organization that handles registration of purebred dogs, and promotes dog shows around the country including the famous Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show."
M_D,"MOD.    	Mod is short for modernist, and described a subculture that originated in London in the late fifties. Mods tended to wear tailored suits, listen to pop music and drove around on Italian motor scooters. Mods came in to conflict with another subculture that emerged at the same time in the UK, the rockers. Rockers were into rock and roll music, and drove motor cycles. I remember as a young kid in school having to declare myself as either a mod or a rocker. I don't think our ""gangs"" back then were quite the same as they are today ..."
OTAR_,"OTARU.    	The city and port of Otaru is just a 25-minute drive northwest from Sapporo. Like it's larger neighbor, Sapporo, Otaru has a famous beer named after it."
M_NX,"MANX.    	I've seen Manx cats by the dozen. They're found all over the Isle of Man (hence the name ""Manx"") located in the middle of the Irish Sea. Manx cats have no tails, they really don't."
RUMB_,"RUMBA.    	The rumba is a Cuban dance, with influences brought by African slaves and Spanish colonists. The name 'rumba' comes from 'rumbo', the Spanish word for 'party, spree'."
MANAN_,MANANA.    	'Mañana' is the Spanish for 'tomorrow'.
_ABLE,"SABLE.    	Sables are small mammals about two feet long, found right across northern Europe and northern Asia. The sable's pelt is highly prized in the fur trade. It is unique among furs in that it feels smooth no matter which direction it is stroked."
OD_TS,"ODETS.    	""Waiting for Lefty"" was the first play by Clifford Odets that made it to stage, in 1935. The storyline deals with cab drivers who are planning a strike. Famously, the play breaks through the ""fourth wall"" by placing actors within the audience who react to the action taking place on the stage."
ACT_,"ACT V.    	One of the most famous Moors in literature is Othello, the title character in William Shakespeare's tragedy ""Othello, the Moor of Venice"". The word ""Moor"" describes various peoples of North Africa, usually of the Muslim faith. At the height of their geographic influence, the Moors occupied much of the Iberian peninsula, calling it Al Andalus (from which modern Andalusia gets its name)."
TAIPE_,"TAIPEI.    	The building known as Taipei 101, in the capital of Taiwan, is so-called because it has 101 floors. It was the tallest skyscraper in the world from 2004 until 2010 when the Burj Khalifa was completed in Dubai."
L_NE,"LONE.    	The concept of being one's own person, going it alone, is popularly known as being a ""maverick"". In the days of open range ranching, a maverick was a steer that didn't carry a brand. An unbranded animal was usually the result of a branded animal giving birth on the open range, with the young growing up without having being captured and claimed by an owner. The use of the name ""maverick"" comes from a Texas rancher, Samuel Maverick, who refused to brand his cattle. He stated that he did not want to inflict pain on his cattle, and so laid claim to any cattle on the range that wasn't branded. His stubborn refusal to cooperate with the neighboring ranchers gave rise to our modern description of a single-minded individual as a ""maverick""."
_EAV,"BEAV.    	We used to see a lot of American television programming growing up in Ireland, but ""Leave It to Beaver"" was one show that didn't make it across the Atlantic. I've seen a couple of episodes, and I am not sure it would travel well. The show went on the air for the first time the day that Sputnik was launched by the Russians, and aired its last show just a few months before President Kennedy was assassinated. An iconic series, by all accounts."
_LEES,"ULEE'S.    	""Ulee's Gold"" is a highly respected film from 1997 in which Peter Fonda plays the title role of Ulee. Ulee's ""gold"" is the honey that Ulee produced. It is a favorite role for Peter Fonda, and he has shared that the role brought into mind his father, Henry Fonda, who himself kept a couple of hives. So if you see Peter Fonda in ""Ulee's Gold"", you're witnessing some characteristics that Peter saw in his father."
BAYO_,"BAYOU.    	The exact origins of the word ""bayou"" is uncertain, but it is though perhaps to come from the Choctaw (a Native American people from the southeast) word ""bayuk"", meaning ""small stream""."

SLAL_M,"SLALOM.    	Slalom is an anglicized version of the Norwegian word ""slalam"", meaning ""skiing race""."

Geos were designed to compete head-to-head with the small imports that were gaining market share at the time in the US. Some Geo models that you might remember are the Metro, the Prizm and the Storm. The cars were actually built as joint-ventures with Japanese manufacturers. The Prizm was a GM/Toyota project, the Metro was GM/Suzuki, and the Storm was GM/Isuzu."
TI_S,"TIAS.    	In Spanish, a 'tia' (aunt) is a member of 'la familia' (the family)."
W_D,"WMD.    	Last week I saw the new Matt Damon film ""Green Zone"". It's a fictional tale (I think!) that goes into the whole subject of WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction) in Iraq. It's a great, contemporary, action, war movie."
S_AMS,"SPAMS.    	Apparently the term ""spam"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word Spam, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""spam"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."
S_OT,"SLOT.    	Slot machines earned the nickname ""one-armed bandits"" simply because they had ""one arm"", the handle pulled to operate the machine, and they robbed you of all your money!"
HEM_,"HEMP.    	Hemp is a hardy, fast-growing plant that has many uses mainly due to the strength of the fibers in the plant's stalks. Hemp is used to make rope, paper and textiles. There is of course a variety of hemp that is grown to make drugs, most famously cannabis."
OLA_I,"OLAF I.    	It is believed that the Norwegian King Olaf I led the conversion of the Vikings to Christianity and built the first church in the country (in 995 CE). Olaf was actually married to an Irishwoman, albeit a woman from a Viking family. Queen Gyda was the sister of the King of Dublin, Olaf Cuaran."
ESC_PE,"ESCAPE.    	Rupert Holmes released 'Escape' in 1979, and over the airways the song was very popular and oft-requested by listeners. Record sales were surprisingly low though, given the good reception. Someone realised that the name was a little deceptive, with many folks not realizing that ""Escape"" was indeed the ""The Piña Colada Song"". The record was re-titled 'Escape (The Piña Colada Song)', and it shot to number one. By the way, when Holmes originally wrote the song, instead of the lyric ""if you like Piña Colada"", he used ""if you like Humphrey Bogart"". Nah, doesn't quite work ..."
OLD_AT,"OLD HAT.    	The use of ""old hat"" to mean something ""out of date, stale"" started about 1911. Before that, the term ""old hat"" meant something very different, and very vulgar. ""Old hat"" was the name given to a very private part of a woman, the idea being that it was ""often felt"" (as in a ""felt hat""). I just don't know what to say ..."
PLE_,"PLEA.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
RIA_TO,"RIALTO.    	The Rialto is the financial and commercial center of Venice, and has been so for centuries. One of the most famous features of the area is the Rialto Bridge that spans the Grand Canal."
_NS,"INS.    	If you're one of the ""ins"", you get a seat at the table."
_IN,"CIN.    	The Red Scare (i.e. anti-communist sentiment) following WWII had such an effect on the populace that it even caused the Cincinnati baseball team to change its name from the Reds. The team was called the Cincinnati Redlegs from 1953-1958, as the management was fearful of losing money due to public distrust of any association with ""Reds""."
TURB_,"TURBO.    	Turbofans and turbojets are types of aircraft engine. Turbofan engines are quite common on large passenger aircraft. Turbojet engines are more efficient at speeds higher than Mach 2, so are more likely to be found on something like a cruise missile."
LIE_,"LIEF.    	Lief means willingly, gladly. A lovely word ..."
C_NOLA,"CANOLA.    	Canola is a type of rapeseed. The oil is made from the seeds. The particular cultivar used in oil production was developed in Canada, and the name Canola comes from ""CANadian Oil, Low Acid""."
FTL_E,"FT LEE.    	Fort Lee, New Jersey is located at the western side of the George Washington Bridge that spans the Hudson River. Fort Lee is known as the birthplace of the motion picture industry.

OR_MEO,"O ROMEO.    	In the balcony scene in Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet', Juliet utters the famous line:"
OLA_I,OLAF I.    	Olaf I was king of Denmark from 1086 to 1095. Olaf is the only Danish king for whom a burial site is not known. There is speculation that his body was cut into pieces and scattered across the country in an effort to rid Denmark of the misfortunes that plagued Olaf's reign as king.
_ENTAL,"RENTAL.    	Netflix ws founded in Los Gatos, California in 1997. The company delivered it's billionth DVD in 2007. I presume the renter wasn't charged for that movie ..."

VOU_,"VOUS.    	In French, the pronouns 'toi' and 'vous' both mean 'you', with the former being used with family and friends, and children. 'Vous' is more formal, and is also the plural form of 'toi'."
_TDS,STDS.    	Standards are norms.
_AMROD,RAMROD.    	A ramrod is a 'stick' that is inserted into the barrel of an older firearm in order to pack the bullet or ball up against the charge of gunpowder.
EN_INO,ENCINO.    	Encino is a district in the City of Los Angeles on the north slope of the Santa Monica Mountains. The area takes its name from a historic parcel of land called Rancho Los Encinos (Ranch of the Evergreens).
_OTE,"TOTE.    	The Public Broadcasting System (PBS) was founded in 1970, and is my favorite of the broadcast networks. I love PBS's drama and science shows in particular, and always watch the election results coming in with the NewsHour team. PBS's Big Bird made a bit of a splash in the last election cycle ..."
S_PAL,"SEPAL.    	The calyx is the collective name for the sepals of a flower, the outermost whorl that forms the flower (the pretty part!)."
NI_ON,"NIKON.    	Nikon was founded in 1917, a merger of three companies making various optical devices. After the merger, the company's main output was lenses (including the first lenses for Canon cameras, before Canon made their own). During the war, Nikon sales grew rapidly as they focused on equipment for the military including periscopes and bomb sights."
UNITA_D,"UNITARD.    	A unitard is like a leotard, except that it has long legs and sometime long sleeves. It wouldn't be a good look for me ..."
BOS_ON,"BOSTON.    	The first modern Olympic marathon race was held in the first modern games, in 1896 in Athens. The very next year, Boston held it's first annual marathon, making it the oldest of the numerous annual marathons held in cities right around the world. The race is held on the third Monday of April each year, Patriots' Day."
_ANREMO,"SAN REMO.    	The Italian city of San Remo sits on the Mediterranean, right on the border with France. In Italian the city is named Sanremo, just one word, although the spelling of ""San Remo"" dates back to ancient times."
UTO_IA,"UTOPIA.    	The word Utopia was invented by Sir Thomas More for his book ""Utopia"" published in 1516, describing an idyllic, fictional island in the Atlantic Ocean. More's use of the name Utopia comes from the Greek ""ou"" meaning ""not"" and ""topos"" meaning ""place"". By calling his perfect island ""Not Place"", More was making the point that he didn't think that the ideal could actually exist."
RENOIR_,"RENOIRS.    	Pierre-Auguste Renoir was a French painter, very much at the forefront of the Impressionist movement. Renoir was a prolific artist, with several thousand works attributed to him. The largest collection of Renoirs is actually in the United States. You can see 181 of his paintings at the Barnes Foundation just outside Philadelphia."
C_IMEA,"CRIMEA.    	Considering that the Crimea was the site of the Charge of the Light Brigade as well as the Yalta conference towards the end of World War II, I am ashamed to say that I could not pinpoint the Crimea on a map. I'm even more ashamed to say that I didn't realize it is an extremely distinctively shaped peninsula, lying south of the Ukraine and jutting into the Black Sea. Well, now I know ..."
POL_,"POLE.    	The decathlon event is a track and field competition, with the name 'decathlon' coming from the Greek 'deka' (ten) and 'athlos' (contest). The ten events in the men's decathlon are:"
_EBS,"REBS.    	Manassas, Virginia was the site of two major battles during the Civil War, the First and Second Battles of Bull Run (also known as the Battles of Manassas). In the first battle, one of the southern brigades was led by Brigadier General Thomas Jackson. His brigade was well-trained and disciplined, so much so that as the Union troops made advances, a fellow-general encouraged his retreating men to hold their positions yelling ""There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer"". There are reports that the actual quote was less complimentary, but regardless, from that day on Jackson was known as ""Stonewall""."
PO_T,"POST.    	Many folks who visit this website regard it as just that, a website. That is true, but more correctly it is referred to as a blog, as I make regular posts (actually daily posts) which then occupy the ""front page"" of the site. The blog entries are in reverse chronological order, and one can just look back day-by-day, reading older and older posts. 'Blog' is a contraction of the term ""web log""."
VI_I,"VICI.    	The oft-quoted ""Veni, vidi, vici"" (""I came, I saw, I conquered"") is believed by many to have been written by Julius Caesar. The words date back to 47 BC and refer to the short war between Rome and Pharnaces II of Pontus."

ES_S,"ESAS.    	Tijuana is the largest city in the Mexican state of Baja California, and lies just across the US-Mexico border from San Diego. Tijuana is also the most westerly of all Mexican cities. A lot of the Tijuana's growth took place in the twenties, as tourists flocked south of the border during the days of prohibition in the US. One of the many casinos and hotels that flourished at that time was Hotel Caesar's, in the Avenida Revolucion area. Hotel Caesar's claims to be the birthplace of the now ubiquitous Caesar Salad."
TAM_,"TAMP.    	""Tamp"" means to pack down tightly by tapping. ""Tamp"" was originally used to specifically describe the action of packing down sand or dirt around an explosive prior to detonation."
H_IA,"HSIA.    	The Xia (also 'Hsia') Dynasty was the first Chinese Dynasty, lasting from about 2070 to 1600 BCE."
NOR_,"NORM.    	The character of Norm Peterson was the only customer of the bar to appear in every episode of ""Cheers"", something that one couldn't call ironic since he loved that barstool! George Wendt played Norm, and I suppose the fact the Wendt was expelled from Notre Dame after one semester, with a 0.0 GPA, that might have helped him get the role!"
_OP,GOP.    	What a great clue! The Grand Old Party.
HE_B,HERB.    	The name of the herb called rosemary comes from the Latin 'ros marinus' which means 'dew of the sea'. The idea is that rosemary can in fact grow in some locations with only the moisture that is carried by a sea breeze.

_IOTACT,"RIOT ACT.    	The Riot Act was a British law that was in force from 1715 to 1967. According to the Riot Act, government entities could declare any gathering of twelve or more people 'unlawful'.

NEC_O,"NECCO.    	Necco Wafers are the best known product line of the candy manufacturer called the New England Confectionery Company. The firm's name is abbreviated to NECCO, an acronym that became synonymous with the wafers."
K_CH,"KOCH.    	Ed Koch was a Democratic Representative in the US Congress from 1969-73, and then Mayor of New York City from 1978-89.

And in 2004, he collaborated with his sister, Pat Koch, and wrote a children's book called ""Eddie, Harold's Little Brother"", a tale about Ed's own childhood experiences."
RAREBI_,"RAREBIT.    	Welsh rarebit is a delicious dish made using a cheese-flavored sauce served over toast. It may be that the name Welsh rarebit was originally a bit of an insult to the folks in Wales. The dish was called Welsh ""rabbit"" back in the 1700s. In those day's rabbit was the poor man's meat, and the implication of the dish's name is that in Wales cheese was the poor man's rabbit."
_URIM,"PURIM.    	Purim is a festival commemorating the deliverance of the Jewish people from a plot to wipe them out by Haman the Agagite, as recorded in the Book of Esther. During the celebration of Purim, the Book of Esther is read aloud, once in the evening and once the following morning.

KIS_,KISS.    	What we call a 'French kiss' is known as a 'baiser amoureux' (lover's kiss) in France.
SI_N,"SION.    	The Priory of Sion is presented in the preface of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", as a secret society that did in fact exist. However, there is a lot of evidence that the priory was an invention, created in forged documents in the sixties. Regardless, Dan Brown's book is a really enjoyable read."
_AR,VAR.    	Dictionaries list variants of words.
NEL_ON,"NELSON.    	The full nelson and half nelson are wrestling holds in which one wrestler secures the opponent by encircling his or her arms under the armpits and around the neck. Some say the hold is named after Admiral Nelson, who was renowned for using encircling tactics in battle."

_EOMEN,"YEOMEN.    	In one use of the word, a yeoman is a lower level official or attendant in a royal household. A famous group of yeomen are the Yeoman Warders of the Tower of London. The role is ceremonial these days, theoretically safeguarding the crown jewels and guarding any prisoners in the Tower. More correctly, the Yeoman Warders are called Beefeaters, and nobody's really sure why! If you get over to London, the Yeoman Warders will be your tour guide around the Tower of London ... a great day out!"
A_IT,"ADIT.    	An adit is specific type of mine access, a horizontal shaft that extends into the mine. This can be compared with the more traditional vertical shaft that is used for access into most mines. Adits make sense when the ore is located inside a mountain or hill, as opposed to ""underground"", so that the mine entrance can be on the valley floor."

Arafat was beaten by his father as a child and so did not have a good relationship with him. Arafat did not attend his father's funeral, nor did he visit his grave.

The team was founded way back in 1929 as the Portsmouth Spartans, from Portsmouth, Ohio. The Spartans joined the NFL during the Great Depression as other franchises collapsed.

CAG_R,"CAGER.    	In the early days of basketball, when a ball went out of bounds possession was awarded to the player who first retrieved the ball. This led to mad scuffles off the court, often involving spectators. As the game became more organized courts were routinely ""caged"", largely because of this out of bounds rule, to limit interaction with the crowd. It's because of these cages that basketball players are sometimes referred to today as ""cagers""."

L_W,"LAW.    	I must have read all of the Perry Mason books when I was in college. I think they kept me sane when I was facing the pressure of exams. Author Erle Stanley Gardner was himself a lawyer, although he didn't get into the profession the easy way. He went to law school, but got himself suspended after a month. So, he became a self-taught attorney and opened his own law office in Merced, California. Understandably, he gave up the law once his novels became successful."

STRAT_,"STRATI.    	Stratus clouds (plural 'strati') are very common, and as they are wider than they are tall and flat along the bottom, we might just see them as haze in a featureless sky above us.

You know how incestuous things are in the European Royal houses, so King Harald V of Norway is in the line of succession for the throne of England (albeit around no. 60)."
EH_E,"EHLE.    	My favorite screen version of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the 1995 miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. The wonderful chemistry that Ehle and Firth exhibited on screen extended off the screen and the pair were 'an item' for a while. Jennifer Ehle was recently again cast with Colin Firth, in the excellent film ""The King's Speech' from 2010."
ISN_,"ISN'T.    	George Harrison wrote ""Isn't It a Pity"" in 1970, for the Beatles White Album, but the song was rejected. Instead, Harrison used it in his solo album ""All Things Must Pass"", and released it as the B-side of the immensely popular ""My Sweet Lord""."
_STER,"OSTER.    	The Oster brand of small appliances was introduced in 1924 by John Oster. He started out by making manually-powered hair clippers designed for cutting women's hair, and followed up with a motorized version in 1928.

Oster was bought up by Sunbeam, which has owned the brand since 1960."
A_ER,"AMER.    	I think the reference here is to VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America created by President Lyndon Johnson, the domestic equivalent  of the Peace Corps. However if I&#8217;m right, the acronym is usually capitalized.  So, maybe I&#8217;m wrong &#8230;"

_ENO,"ZENO.    	Zeno of Elea was a Greek philosopher who lived in Elea, a Greek colony in Southern Italy. Zeno is famous for his 'paradoxes', a set of problems that really make you think! In the problem known as 'Achilles and the Tortoise', Zeno tells us that Achilles races a tortoise, giving the tortoise a head start (of say 100 meters). By the time Achilles reaches the starting point of the tortoise, the tortoise will have moved on, albeit only a small distance. Achilles then sets his sights on the tortoise's new position and runs to it. Again the tortoise has moved ahead a little. Achilles keeps on moving to the tortoise's new position but can never actually catch his slower rival. Or can he ...?"

S_TIE,"SATIE.    	Erik Satie was a French composer most famous for his beautiful composition, the three 'Gymnopédies'. I have tried so hard to appreciate other works by Satie but I find them so very different from the minimalist simplicity of the lyrical 'Gymnopédies'."

One of the company's products was a line of half-spheres that were welded together to make buoys used in Lake Michigan.

As the various states broke up, they spawned many duchies that retained the name ""Saxe"", the most famous probably being Saxe-Coburg and Gothe, two united duchies in Germany that ceased to exist after WWII.

YAS_R,"YASIR.    	Yasser (also Yasir) Arafat was born in Cairo in 1929, the son of two Palestinians and the second-youngest of seven children. Arafat was beaten by his father as a child, and so he did not have a good relationship with him. Arafat did not attend his father's funeral, nor did he visit his grave. The beatings were apparently administered because the young Arafat was repeatedly attending religious services in the Jewish quarter of Cairo. This infuriated his father, while Arafat's explanation was that he wanted to ""study the mentality"" of the Jewish people."
