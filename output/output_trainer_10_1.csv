Nine-digit govt.   		4 letters,"SSNS.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, a SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax forms who did not exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in the following year's tax returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

Boats like the one Noah built.   		4 letters,"ARKS.    	The term 'ark', when used with reference to Noah, is a translation of the Hebrew word 'tebah'. The word 'tebah' is also used in the Bible for the basket in which Moses was placed by his mother when she floated him down the Nile. It seems that the word 'tebah' doesn't mean 'boat' and nor does it mean 'basket'. Rather, a more appropriate translation is 'life-preserver' or 'life-saver'.

Young newt.   		3 letters,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."
