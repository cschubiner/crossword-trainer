IK_,"IKE.    	When the future president was growing up, the Eisenhower family used the nickname 'Ike' for all seven boys in the family, as 'Ike' was seen as an abbreviation for the family name. 'Big Ike' was Edgar, the second oldest boy. 'Little/Young Ike' was Dwight, who was the third son born. Dwight had no sisters."
_VA,"EVA.    	Nowadays, President Juan Perón of Argentina is perhaps less well-known than his second wife, Eva Perón of ""Evita"" fame. Juan and Eva Perón were overthrown in a military coup in 1955, although Juan Perón was returned to power in 1973 when he served for only nine months before he passed away. Juan was succeeded in office by his third wife, Isabel Perón."

_TIS,OTIS.    	Shuggie Otis is the son of R7B musician Johnny Otis.
_EL,"EEL.    	Electrophorus electricus is the biological name for the electric eel. Despite its name, the electric ""eel"" isn't an eel at all, but rather what is called a knifefish, a fish with an elongated body related to the catfish. The electric eel has three pairs of organs along its abdomen, each capable of generating an electric discharge. The shock can go as high as 500 volts with 1 ampere of current (that's 500 watts), and that could perhaps kill a human."
SO_,"SOS.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
O_CA,"ORCA.    	The taxonomic name for the killer whale is Orcinus orca. The use of the name ""orca"" is becoming more and more common in English. The Latin word ""Orcinus"" means ""belonging to Orcus"", with Orcus being the name for the Kingdom of the Dead."
NE_O,"NERO.    	The Roman Emperor Nero has a large (30m tall) statue made of himself in bronze, which he located outside of his palace. After he died, the bronze was altered and renamed the Colossus Solis, after the Roman sun god. It was later moved and located near the huge amphitheater that became known as the Colosseum. It is likely that the amphitheater actually took its name from the Colossus statue."
OR_A,"ORCA.    	'Jaws' is a thrilling 1975 movie directed by Steven Spielberg that is based on a novel of the same name by Peter Benchley. The film has a powerful cast, led by Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. 'Jaws' was perhaps the first 'summer blockbuster' with the highest box office take in history, a record that stood until 'Star Wars' was released two years later."

_NN,"ANN.    	Cape Ann is 30 miles north of Boston and is on the northernmost edge of Massachusetts Bay. The Cape was first mapped by the explorer John Smith. Early in his adventurous life Smith had been captured and enslaved by the Ottoman Empire. His ""owner"" in his days of slavery was a woman called Tragabigzanda, and apparently the slave and owner fell in love. Smith originally called Cape Tragabigzanda in her memory, but King Charles I changed the name to Cape Ann in honor of his own mother, Anne of Denmark."
SS_,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation although, given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax returns who did not really exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in the following year's returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

I_E,"IKE.    	President Eisenhower was born in Denison, Texas and given the name David Dwight Eisenhower, but by the time he made it to the White House he was going by the name Dwight D.

Estonia has been overrun and ruled by various empires over the centuries. Estonia did enjoy a few years of freedom at the beginning of the 20th century after a war of independence against the Russian Empire. However, the country was occupied again during WWII, first by the Russians and then the Germans, and reoccupied by the Soviets in 1944. Estonia has flourished as an independent country again since the collapse of the USSR in 1991."

E_K,"ELK.    	The elk (also known as the wapiti) is the one of the largest species of deer in the world, with only the moose being bigger. Early European settlers were used to seeing the smaller red deer back in their homelands, so when they saw the ""huge"" wapiti they assumed it was a moose, and incorrectly gave it the European name for a moose, namely ""elk"". The more correct term then is ""wapiti"", the Shawnee name for the animal, which means ""white rump"". It's all very confusing ..."

Cleopatra observed such executions noting that the venom brought on sleepiness without any painful spasms. When the great queen opted to commit suicide, the asp's bite was therefore her chosen method."

At the moment of that first kick, Mama DiCaprio was looking at a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, and so named her son Leonardo."
L_O,"LEO.    	There has been a lion in the logo of the MGM studio since 1924. The original was an Irishman (!), a lion named Slats who was born in Dublin Zoo in 1919. However, it wasn't until Jackie took over from Slats in 1928 that the roar was heard, as the era of silent movies was coming to an end. The current lion is called Leo, and he has been around since 1957."
EV_,"EVA.    	Eva Gabor was the youngest of the Gabor sisters all three of whom were celebrated Holywood actresses and socialites (her siblings were Zsa-Zsa and Magda). The Gabor sisters were born in Budapest and immigrated to the United States separately, with Eva being the first to arrive. Eva broke into movies, but her most famous role was on the TV sitcom ""Green Acres"" in which she played the lovely character Lisa Douglas opposite Eddie Albert. One of Eva's claims to fame is the unwitting promotion of the game called ""Twister"", the sales of which was languishing in 1996. In an appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" she got on all fours and played the game with Johnny Carson. Sales took off immediately, and Twister became a huge hit."
ANN_,"ANNE.    	Tradition states that Mary, Mother of Jesus was the daughter of Joachim and Anne."

_OL,"AOL.    	Founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1983, the company changed its name in 1989 to America Online. As America Online went international, the acronym AOL was used in order to shake off the ""America-centric"" sound to the name. During the heady days of AOL's success the company could not keep up with the growing number of subscribers, so people trying to connect often encountered busy signals. That's when users referred to AOL as ""Always Off-Line""."
UM_,"UMA.    	Robert Thurman was the first westerner to be ordained a Tibetan Buddhist monk. Robert raised his children in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and called his daughter ""Uma"" as it is a phonetic spelling of the Buddhist name ""Dbuma"".

My favorite Uma Thurman film is the wonderful 1996 romantic comedy 'The Truth About Cats and Dogs'."

'CSI: Miami' (the 'worst' of the franchise, I think) was cancelled in 2012 after ten seasons. 'CSI: NY' (the 'best' of the franchise) was cancelled in 2013 after nine seasons. The original 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation', set in Las Vegas, hung in there until 2015 when it ended with a two-hour TV movie.

_TIS,"OTIS.    	Elevators (simple hoists) have been around for a long time. What Elisha Otis did was come up with the ""safety elevator"", a design that he showcased at the 1853 World's Fair in New York. At the Fair, Otis would stand on an elevated platform in front of onlookers and order his assistant to cut the single rope holding up the platform. His safety system kicked in when the platform had only fallen a few inches, amazing the crowd. After this demonstration, the orders came rolling in."

EE_,"EEL.    	Anyone going to a sushi restaurant can order all types of raw fish (known collectively as 'sashimi'). However, eel is always served cooked, and that's because the blood of eels contains a protein that cramps muscles if eaten. If the heart muscle 'cramps', the result can be death. The protein is easily rendered harmless by applying heat, i.e. cooking."

The story takes place in the 1800s on Antiterra, an Earth-like planet that has a history similar to ours but with interesting differences. For example, there is a United States, but the country covers all of North and South America. What we call eastern Canada is a French-speaking province called ""Canady"", and western Canada is a Russian-speaking province ""Estody"".

Pretty soon other settlers built homes nearby and in 1891 the settlement got its own post office. As postman, Reed got to name the new post office and he called it Ada, after his oldest daughter.

I don't care though, as I just think it's fun television.

The show opened in London in 1985, and is the longest running musical in the history of London's West End. My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The theater seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the storyline is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even having a cigarette. On cue they would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

That's when users called AOL ""Always Off-Line""."

Mary II died before her husband, and so William III ruled alone for the last six years of his life. When William passed away in 1702, his wife's sister ascended to the throne as Anne, Queen of Great Britain. Anne, was the last British monarch from the House of Stuart, as she died without issue.

As there is a '1' (implied) before the 'x', then the slope of the line is said to be 1. Another way to arrive at the value of the slope is to take the derivative of the function with respect to x, and that turns out to be 1 as well."

There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax forms who did not exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5.

For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist.

_SI,"CSI.    	The TV show ""CSI"" gets a lot of criticism from law enforcement agencies for its unrealistic portrayal of the procedures and science of criminal investigation. I don't care though, as I just think it's a fun show to watch.

_LK,"ELK.    	The elk (also known as the wapiti) is the one of the largest species of deer in the world, with only the moose being bigger. Early European settlers were familiar with the smaller red deer back in their homelands, so when they saw the ""huge"" wapiti they assumed it was a moose, and incorrectly gave it the European name for a moose, namely ""elk"".

SS_,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, the SSN is looking more and more like an ""universal identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, a SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax forms who did not exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in the following year's tax returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."

E_ON,"ETON.    	""A Yank at Eton"" was released in 1942, and is a sequel to the 1938 comedy ""A Yank at Oxford"".

This was helpful as American forces were pouring into the UK in preparation for the invasion of Europe during WWII."
A_L,"AOL.    	Founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1983, the company changed its name in 1989 to America Online. As America Online went international, the acronym AOL was used in order to shake off the ""America-centric"" sound to the name. During the heady days of AOL's success the company could not keep up with the growing number of subscribers, so people trying to connect often encountered busy signals.
