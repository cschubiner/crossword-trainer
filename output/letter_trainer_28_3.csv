Olestra is instead made of several fatty acid chains held together by a sucrose molecule. Olestra has a similar taste and consistency as natural fat, but has zero caloric impact as it is too large a molecule to pass through the intestinal wall and passes right out of the body.

""The Seven Year Itch"" stars Marilyn Monroe, and Tom Ewell as the guy with ""the itch"". Perhaps the most famous scene in the film is the one with Monroe standing over a subway grate allowing the updraft to billow the skirt of her white dress above her knees. The manoeuvre was meant to cool her down, but I think it had the opposite effect on some in the audience! The phrase ""seven year itch"" had been used by psychologists to describe declining interest in staying monogamous after seven years of marriage."
_YLE,"PYLE.    	Ernie Pyle was a journalist, truly a roving reporter, never happy unless he was filing stories from some remote part of the country or some far-flung corner of the globe.

The city's name was chosen by the Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, apparently after the middle name of the daughter of Governor Wilson Lumpkin: 'Atalanta'."
KAHL_,"KAHLO.    	Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter, famous for her self-portraits. She was married to the equally famous artist Diego Rivera. Kahlo was portrayed by the actress Salma Hayek in a film about her colorful life called 'Frida' released in 2002."
NAUT_LUS,"NAUTILUS.    	The marine creature called a nautilus is referred to as a ""living fossil"", as it looks just like the spiral-shelled creatures that are commonly found in fossils. The spiral shape is a great example of the Fibonacci series defining a natural phenomenon, as the spiral is a Fibonacci spiral, described by the famous series of numbers."
MA_ACA,"MARACA.    	Maracas are percussion instruments native to Latin America. Maracas are constructed from a dried shell, like that of a coconut, to which a handle is attached. The shell is filled with dried seeds or beans, and shaken."
_ESMIZ,"LES MIZ.    	The 1980 musical ""Les Misérables"" is an adaptation of the 1862 novel of the same name by Victor Hugo. The show opened in London in 1985, and is the longest running musical in the history of London's West End. My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The theater seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the storyline is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even smoking cigarettes. On cue, the stagehands would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the musical version of the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

He then moved into comedy, and ended up on the ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"". He left ""The Daily Show"" in 2005 to set up his own spin-off, ""The Colbert Report"". In his own inimitable way, Colbert likes to use a ""French"" pronunciation for the name of his show, so ""The Colbert Report"" comes out as ""The Col-bear Rep-oar""."
TENNES_EE,"TENNESSEE.    	The Tennessee Titans are a football team based in Nashville. The team relocated to Nashville from Houston in 1997, and was called the Tennessee Oilers for two seasons, before adopting the 'Titans' moniker."

_ING,"RING.    	Growth rings can be seen in a horizontal cross section of a tree trunk. These rings are caused by the change in rate of a growth of a tree that comes with the seasons, so the rings are more easily discerned in trees that grow in regions with marked seasonal changes."
_AUCE,"SAUCE.    	Worcestershire Sauce is a variant of a fermented fish sauce that has been around since the days of the Roman Empire. The modern sauce was developed and marketed by Messrs.

Oh, and ""Worcestershire"" is pronounced ""wooster-sheer"" ..."
ARE_DT,"ARENDT.    	Hannah Arendt was studying and working the field of philosophy when she had to flee her native Germany in the runup to WWII because of her Jewish heritage.

B_N,"BAN.    	Ban was the first roll-on deodorant, introduced in 1952. The formulation for Ban is the same as the brand called Mum, the first commercial deodorant, which dates back to the late 1800s."
JAZZ_GE,"JAZZ AGE.    	The wonderful 1975 musical 'Chicago' is based on a 1926 play of the same name written by a news reporter called Maurine Dallas Watkins. Watkins had been assigned to cover the murder trials of Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner for the 'Chicago Tribune', and used the story that unfolded as the basis for her play. Annan became the character Roxie Hart, and Gaertner became Velma Kelly. I've only ever seen the movie version of 'Chicago' and never a live performance ..."
NI_S,NIPS.    	Cheese Nips are small crackers made by Kraft under the Nabisco brand name. Cheese Nips have been around since 1955 and you can even buy them in the shape of Spongebob Squarepants (just in case you're into that kind of thing).

"_Y""","NY"".    	The actress Sela Ward turns up in crosswords a lot. Ward played Teddy Reed in the TV show ""Sisters"" in the nineties, and was in ""Once and Again"" from 1999-2002. I don't know either show, but I do know Ward from the medical drama ""House"" in which she played the hospital's lawyer and Greg House's ex-partner. That was a fun role, I thought. More recently Ward has been playing a lead role on ""CSI: NY"" and is a very welcome and much-needed addition to the cast ..."

SHIR_,"SHIRE.    	The word ""shire"" comes from the Old English ""scir"" meaning ""administrative district"". The term was replaced with county as far back as the 14th century, but the usage persists to this day, largely because some counties retain the use of -shire as a suffix (Derbyshire, Lancashire etc.)."
M_NETA,"MINETA.    	Norman Mineta had the distinction of being the only Democratic politician to serve at cabinet level in the administration of President George W. Bush, holding the position of US Secretary of Transportation.

_LAX,"FLAX.    	Rolling papers (also 'cigarette papers') are used as the outer container for the tobacco (or other 'leaf') in a cigarette. Rolling papers are made from wood pulp, hemp, flax or rice straw. Apparently, roll-you-own cigarettes are the fastest growing segment of the US market. Smoking roll-your-owns avoids the taxes paid on manufactured cigarettes."
JSBA_H,"JS BACH.    	Like so many of the great composers, the extent of Bach's contribution to the repertoire wasn't fully recognized until long after his passing. I think that Johann Sebastian Bach was the greatest composer of the Baroque period, and is ranked by many as the greatest classical composer of all time."
TOR_,TORY.    	A member of the Conservative Party in the UK is known as a Tory.
ROY_L,"ROYAL.    	The royal 'we' is more correctly called the majestic plural, and is the use of a plural pronoun to describe a single person in a high office. I suppose the most often quoted phrase that uses the majestic plural is, 'We are not amused', uttered by Queen Victoria."
S_O,"STO.    	Pou sto is Greek, meaning ""where I may stand"". The phrase has it roots in words spoken by Archimedes, who said that he could move the earth if given a place to stand. In contemporary use it describes a place on which to stand, or a basis of operation."
LO_AN,"LOHAN.    	I think that actress Lindsay Lohan's big break was in the Disney remake of 'The Parent Trap' in 1998. I've really only enjoyed one of Lohan's films though, 'Freaky Friday' from 2003 in which she stars alongside the fabulous Jamie Lee Curtis."
SPEED_S,"SPEEDOS.    	Speedo brand swim-wear was first produced in Australia in 1928, by a hosiery company that wanted to diversify. The brand name was chosen after a slogan competition among employees was won by ""Speed on in your Speedos"". It was a long time ago, I guess ..."
OIL_RS,OILERS.    	An 'oiler' is an oil tanker.
_HS,"VHS.    	The video standard known as VHS is more fully referred to as the Video Home System. VHS was one of many standards touted by various manufacturers in the seventies. The biggest rival to VHS was of course Betamax, but we all knew who won the final round in that fight."

_TIPE,"STIPE.    	A mushroom isn't a complete living organism per se, but rather is one part of a fungus, the fruiting body that is responsible for distributing reproductive spores.

SE_E,"SESE.    	Mobutu Sese Seko was the longtime President of Zaire (later to be called the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Mobuto was known to be a very corrupt dictator and it is believed that he embezzled over $5 billion from his country. On a lighter note, Mobutu was the money man between the famous 1974 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman known as 'The Rumble in the Jungle'. Mobutu was anxious to expand the image of Zaire so he used his nation's funds to entice the fighters to have a go at each other in his homeland."
NE_R,NEAR.    	(65. See 1-Across : MISS)
SW_HILI,"SWAHILI.    	Swahili is indeed a widespread language in Africa, but only 5-10 million people speak it as their native language. But there are a lot more speakers than those who use it as a native tongue as Swahili is also the national, official language of at least four countries: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Also, within much of East Africa, Swahili is often spoken as the common language (lingua franca) between people who have different native tongues."
_ENGA,"JENGA.    	Jenga is a simple but very entertaining game, one in which one stacks wooden blocks as high as possible until the resulting tower collapses. 'Jenga' is the Swahili word for 'to build'"
EC_,"ECH.    	We use the word echelon (ech.) to describe a rank, particularly in the military. The term comes from French, in which language it has the same meaning, although the original meaning in Old French is 'rung of a ladder'."
G_JOES,"GI JOES.    	G.I. Joe was the original ""action figure"", the first toy to carry that description. G.I. Joe first hit the shelves in 1964. There have been a few movies based on the G.I. Joe figure, but, more famous than all of them I would say is the 1997 movie ""G.I. Jane"" starring Demi Moore in the title role. I think this movie had some potential, to be honest, but it really did not deliver at all."

She was assassinated in 1984 by two of her own bodyguards, as she was walking to meet Peter Ustinov who was about to interview her for Irish television."
CHA_,"CHAS.    	Chas Addams was a cartoonist. He didn't draw a cartoon strip and rather individual cartoons, although many of his cartoons did feature regular characters.

YERT_E,"YERTLE.    	""Yertle the Turtle"" is a story by Dr. Seuss. The book is noted for the inclusion of the word ""burp"", which back in 1958 when it was published, was considered to be vulgar. But no one seemed to mind!"

After a number of transitions, in 1914 the team took on the name ""Indians"". The media came up with name ""Indians"" after being asked for suggestions by the team owners. ""Indians"" was inspired by the successful Boston team of the day, the Boston Braves."
E_SENE,"ESSENE.    	The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered over a period of years, between 1947 and 1956, in eleven caves on the shores of the Dead Sea.

Many of the texts are copies of writings from the Hebrew Bible."
JE_GA,JENGA.    	'Jenga' is the Swahili word for 'build!'
_HOMB,"RHOMB.    	Rhomb is an alternative name for a rhombus, a 4-sided figure with sides of equal length, but angles at the corners that aren't right angles. So, that would make a rhombus a ""diamond"" shape."
_UBAI,"DUBAI.    	Burj Khalifa is a spectacular skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is the tallest man-made structure in the world, and has been so since the completion of its exterior in 2009. The space in the building came onto the market at a really bad time, during the global financial crisis. The building was part of a US$20 billion development of downtown Dubai that was backed by the city government which had to go looking for a bailout from the neighboring city of Abu Dhabi. The tower was given the name Burj Khalifa at the last minute, apparently as a nod to the UAE president Khalifa bi Zayed Al Nahyan who helped to broker the bailout."
_AX,"TAX.    	The famous destroying of tea in Boston Harbor to protest against the Tax Act took place on December 16, 1773. The action was referred to as the 'destruction of the tea' for decades, and it wasn't until 1834 that the term 'Boston Tea Party' first appeared in print."
SE_MY,"SEAMY.    	We've used ""seamy"" to mean ""the least pleasant, the worst"" since the 1600s. The idea comes from the seamed side of a sewn garment being the less attractive."
ST_REOS,"STEREOS.    	Monophonic sound (""mono"") is sound reproduced using just one audio channel, which is usually played out of just one speaker. Stereophonic sound is reproduced using two audio channels, with the sound from each channel played out of two different speakers.

FO_E,"FORE.    	No one seems to know for sure where the term ""fore!"" comes from. It has been used at least as far back as 1881, and has always been called out to warn other golfers that a wayward ball might be heading their way. My favorite possibility for its origin is that it is a contraction of the Gaelic warning cry ""Faugh a Ballach!"" (clear the way!) which is still called out in the sport of road bowling, a game where players bowl balls along roads between villages, trying to do reach the end of the course in as few bowls as possible, just like in golf!"
DOR_,"DORM.    	Rice University is a private school in Houston, Texas. William Marsh Rice had made a will endowing the funds for the establishment of the school at the time of his death. When he was found dead one morning in his bed, his lawyer announced that his will had been changed, with the bulk of Rice's estate actually going to the lawyer making the announcement. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the lawyer had paid Rice's valet to murder his employer using chloroform and a fake will was written. Eventually the original will was deemed valid, and the funds were disbursed so that the school could be built."
K_AUT,"KRAUT.    	""Sauerkraut"" translates from German as ""sour herb"" or ""sour cabbage"". During WWI, American sauerkraut producers changed its name in order to distance their product from ""the enemy"". They called it ""Liberty cabbage""."

Faced with non-payment, Shylock demands his legal right to ""a pound of flesh""."
N_VAE,"NOVAE.    	A nova is basically a star that suddenly gets much brighter, gradually returning to its original state weeks or even years later. The increased brightness of a nova is due to increased nuclear activity causing the star to pick up extra hydrogen from a neighboring celestial body. A supernova is very different from a nova. A supernova is a very bright burst of light and energy created when most of the material in a star explodes. The bright burst of a supernova is very short-lived compared to the sustained brightness of a nova."
M_NA,"MENA.    	Mena Suvari's most famous role to date is the ""beauty"" in the 1999 movie ""American Beauty"". In the film, Suvari plays the teenage girl with whom the Kevin Spacey character becomes infatuated."

T_PA,"TAPA.    	""Tapa"" is the Spanish word for ""lid"", and there is no clear rationale for why this word came to be used for an appetizer. There are lots of explanations cited, all of which seem to involve the temporary covering of one's glass of wine with a plate or item of food to either preserve the wine or give one extra space at the table."
SERI_S,"SERIES.    	""The Office"" is set in a branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. If you haven't seen the original UK version, starring Ricky Gervais, I do recommend you check it out. Having said that, the US cast has taken the show to a whole new level. Great television ..."

An MRI on the other hand (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), uses powerful magnetic fields to generate its images so there is no exposure to ionizing radiation (such as X-rays). We used MRI equipment in our chemistry labs at school, way back in the days when the technology was still called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMRI).
