___ v.   		3 letters,"ROE.    	Roe v. Wade was decided in a US District Court in Texas in 1970, and reached the Supreme Court on appeal. The basic decision by the Supreme Court was that a woman's constitutional right to privacy applied to an abortion, but that this right had to be balanced with a state's interest in protecting an unborn child, and a mother's health. The Court further defined that the state's interest became stronger with each trimester of a pregnancy. So, in the first trimester, the woman's right to privacy outweighed any state interest. In the second trimester, the state's interest in maternal health was deemed to be strong enough to allow state regulation of abortion for the sake of the mother. In the third trimester, the viability of the fetus dictated that the state's interest in the unborn child came into play, so states could regulate or prohibit abortions, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger. I'm no lawyer, but that's my understanding of the initial Supreme Court decision ..."

___ of March.   		4 letters,"IDES.    	Julius Caesar was assassinated on the 15th (the ides) of March, 44 BC. He was attacked by a group of sixty people in the Roman Senate, and was stabbed 23 times. The first to strike a blow was Servilius Casca, who attacked Caesar from behind and stabbed him in the neck. In Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar', Casca utters the words 'Speak, hands, for me!' just before making the fatal blow. The following line, uttered by Caesar, is more famous though: 'Et tu, Brute?'"
Roman calendar day.   		4 letters,"IDES.    	There were three important days in each month of the old Roman calendar. These days originally depended on the cycles of the moon but were eventually ""fixed"" by law. ""Kalendae"" were the first days of each month, originally the days of the new moon. ""Nonae"" were originally the days of the half moon. And ""idus"" (the ides) was originally the day of the full moon, eventually fixed at the 15th day of a month.

Dutch cheese.   		4 letters,"EDAM.    	Edam cheese takes its name from the Dutch town of Edam in North Holland. The cheese is famous for its coating of red paraffin wax, a layer of protection that helps Edam travel well and prevents spoiling.

Med.   		3 letters,"MRI.    	A CT (or ""CAT"") scan produces (via computer manipulation) a three dimensional image of the inside of an object, usually the human body. It does so by taking a series of two dimensional x-ray images while rotating the camera around the patient. The issue with CT scans is that they use x-rays, and high doses of radiation can be harmful causing damage that is cumulative over time. An MRI on the other hand (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), uses powerful magnetic fields to generate its images so there is no exposure to ionizing radiation (such as X-rays). We used MRI equipment in our chemistry labs at school, way back in the days when the technology was still called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMRI). Apparently the marketing folks didn't like the term ""nuclear"" because of its association with atomic bombs, so now it's just called MRI."

Lauder introduced her own line of fragrances in 1953, a bath oil called ""Youth Dew"". ""Youth Dew"" was marketed as a perfume, but it was added to bathwater.

Hi-___.   		3 letters,"RES.    	In the digital world, resolution of a display, television, image etc. is defined by the number of pixels that can be displayed in a standard area (say a square inch). The emphasis today is on producing larger area displays/televisions, i.e increasing the number of pixels simply by increasing the size of the screen. In the past couple of decades the emphasis was on adding more pixels within the same screen size to increase resolution. This would just be wasted effort these days as further increases in resolution cannot be perceived by the eye. Now that TVs are capable of displaying such high resolutions, broadcasters are responding by producing a video signal of higher resolution that they call high-definition television, HDTV."
