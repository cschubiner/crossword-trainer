Our use of AM and PM dates back to Roman times, with AM standing for Ante Meridiem (before noon) and PM standing for Post Meridiem (after noon).

HA_H,"HASH.    	""Hash"", meaning a dish of beef and vegetables mashed together, is a very American term and one that really surprised me when I first came across it. ""Hash"" just seems like such an unappetizing item, but I soon found out how delicious it was. The name ""hash"" in this context comes from the French ""hacher"" meaning ""to chop"".

Rod Serling eventually chose to narrate his epic 'The Twilight Zone' series himself, but his first choice for narrator had been Richard Egan.

_AN,"JAN.    	Johannes (also 'Jan') Vermeer was born in the city of Delft in 1632, and died there some 43 years later. I just love Vermeer's paintings, and his wonderful use of light. A great example of such a work is his ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". If you haven't seen it, I thoroughly recommend the 2003 movie ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" starring Scarlett Johansson as the girl in the painting, and Colin Firth as Vermeer. The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, so it's all just a great story as opposed to a documentary. The way the movie is shot really reflects the qualities of a Vermeer work of art. And, my wife and i are planning on taking a peek at the original painting 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' in a couple of weeks as it is visiting one of our galleries here in San Francisco."
MAT_,"MATE.    	In the game of chess, when the king is under immediate threat of capture it is said to be ""in check"".

Then a rule was introduced requiring that a warning be given if capture was imminent (today we announce ""check!"") so that an accidental and early ending to the game doesn't occur."

B_CA,"BOCA.    	The name of the city of Boca Raton in Florida translates from Spanish as 'Mouse Mouth'. There doesn't seem to be a definitive etymology of the name but one plausible explanation is a nautical one. 'Boca', as well as meaning 'mouth' can mean 'inlet'.

Funnily enough, the three 'musketeers"" really don't use their muskets, and are better known for their prowess with their swords."
_ONHO,"DON HO.    	Don Ho apparently had a pretty liberal arrangement with his wife. When Ho was touring with his two backing singers, Patti Swallie and Elizabeth Guevara, all three of them shared a room together. He had two children with each of his roommates, giving a total of ten kids including the six he had with his wife. The arrangement was quite open, it seems, with all ten kids visiting each other regularly. To each his own ..."
SPAR_A,"SPARTA.    	Sparta was a city-state in ancient Greece, famous for her military might. Spartan children had a tough upbringing, and newborn babies were bathed in wine to see if the child was strong enough to survive. Every child was presented to a council of elders that decided if the baby was suitable for rearing. Those children deemed too puny were executed by tossing them into a chasm.

AM_,"AMS.    	The 12-hour clock has been around a long time, and was even used in sundial format in Ancient Egypt. Our use of AM and PM dates back to Roman times, with AM standing for Ante Meridiem (before noon) and PM standing for Post Meridiem (after noon).

NIGE_,"NIGER.    	Uranium is the largest export for the country of Niger in Western Africa.

O_K,"ORK.    	""Mork & Mindy"" was broadcast from 1978 to 1982. We were first introduced to Mork (played by Robin Williams) in a special episode of ""Happy Days"". The particular episode in question has a bizarre storyline culminating in Fonzie and Mork having a thumb-to-finger duel. Eventually Richie wakes up in bed, and alien Mork was just part of a dream! Oh, and ""Nanu Nanu"" means both ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" back on the planet Ork. ""I am Mork from Ork, Nanu Nanu"". Great stuff ..."
_SC,USC.    	The Gamecocks are the varsity sports teams of the University of South Carolina. The moniker comes from the nickname given to the Revolutionary war hero Thomas Sumter who was from South Carolina. Sumter was known as the 'Carolina Gamecock' in view of his fierce fighting style.

ME_SE,"MEESE.    	Ed Meese was born in Oakland, California just down the road here and spent 24 years in the office of the Treasurer of Alameda County, the county in which I live.

_ASH,"HASH.    	""Hash"", meaning a dish of beef and vegetables mashed together, is a very American term and one that really surprised me when I first came across it. ""Hash"" just seems like such an unappetizing item, but I soon found out how delicious it was. The name ""hash"" in this context comes from the French ""hacher"" meaning ""to chop"". Back in the early 1900s the dish called ""hashed browned potatoes"" was developed, which quickly morphed into ""hash browns"". From there the likes of corned beef hash was introduced."

H_IKU,"HAIKU.    	A haiku is a very elegant form of Japanese verse. When writing a haiku in English we tend to impose the rule that the verse must contain 17 syllables. This restriction comes from the rule in Japanese that the verse must contain 17 sound units called ""moras"", but moras and syllables aren't the same thing. What the difference is though, is not so clear to me. Here's an example of a Haiku:"

The University of Mississippi sports teams have been known as the Rebels since 1936. Prior to 1936, they were known as the Mississippi Flood."
_ELL,"DELL.    	Dell, the computer manufacturer, is named after the company's founder Michael Dell. Michael Dell started his company in his dorm room at college, shipping personal computers that were customized to the specific needs of his customers.

EL_SE,"ELYSE.    	""Family Ties"" was one of the first TV shows that I enjoyed when I arrived in the US back in 1983. I found the situation very appealing, with two ex-hippie parents facing off against an ultra-conservative son. The main characters in the show were Michael J. Fox as Alex, Meredith Baxter-Birney as Alex's mom, Elyse, and Michael Gross as Alex's Dad, Steven. But some future stars had recurring roles as well, including Courteney Cox as one of Alex's girlfriends and Tom Hanks as Elyse's young brother."

X_CTO,"X-ACTO.    	The X-Acto knife was invented in the thirties by a Polish immigrant, although his intention was to come up with a scalpel for surgeons.

MED_,"MEDE.    	The Medes were an ancient people that lived in what is now northwestern Iran. The Medes held sway in the region only for about 60 years, until Cyrus the Great came along and defeated Astyages, the king of Media (not to be confused with Howard Stern, the self-proclaimed ""king of all media""!)."
