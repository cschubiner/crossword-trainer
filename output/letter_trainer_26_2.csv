UCO_N,"UCONN.    	The UConn Huskies are the sports teams of the University of Connecticut. I wasn't able to uncover the derivation of the 'Huskies' moniker. Although it is true that 'UConn' sounds like 'Yukon', that isn't the derivation of the 'Huskies' nickname as the school didn't become the University of Connecticut (UConn) until 1939, and the Huskies name has been used since 1933."

C_OPER,"COOPER.    	The original mini was a fabulous car, one that I drove all over Ireland in my youth. It had a unique front-wheel-drive layout that took up very little space, allowing for a lot of room (relatively speaking) for passengers and baggage. One space-saving trick was to mount the engine transversely, so it sits rotated 90 degrees from the norm. That engine had a capacity of only 848cc.

H_SS,"HOSS.    	Dan Blocker was the actor who played Hoss Cartwright in the famous TV show ""Bonanza"". Hoss was the ""slow"" character on the show. Paradoxically, Dan Blocker was the most educated member of the cast, having earned a Masters Degree in the dramatic arts. Blocker passed away while ""Bonanza"" was still running. He was undergoing relatively routine gallbladder surgery and developed a pulmonary embolism which killed him. Bonanza ran for just one more season after Blocker passed away."

Rolex watches were made available to the Canadian servicemen at that time as they were shipping overseas. My uncle brought his Rolex home to Ireland after the war. He needed money for booze one weekend and so sold the watch to my Dad, for five pounds. My Dad gave it to me just before he died, as he knew I loved the watch, and my brothers weren't interested in it all. Not so long ago I had the watch appraised ($3,000!), and my brothers all of a sudden took a liking to it! Still, it's not something that will ever be sold ..."
CA_ER,"CAGER.    	In the early days of basketball, when a ball went out of bounds possession was awarded to the player who first retrieved the ball. This led to mad scuffles off the court, often involving spectators.

It's because of these cages that basketball players are sometimes referred to today as ""cagers""."

YW_A,"YWCA.    	The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) was founded in the late 1800s about 50 years after the YMCA, although the two organizations have always been independent of each other.

The YWCA is quite the organization, and is the largest women's group in the whole world."

Hrothgar had built a great hall for his people in which they could celebrate; singing, dancing and drinking lots of mead.

A_IG,"ALI G.    	Ali G is a fictional character created by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. Baron Cohen achieved international fame playing another of his personae, Borat, the protagonist in the 2006 movie ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan""."

SO_P,"SOAP.    	As almost everyone knows, the original soap operas were radio dramas back in the fifties. Given the structure of society back then, the daytime broadcasts were aimed at housewives working in the home. For some reason the sponsors of those radio shows, and the television shows that followed, were soap manufacturers like Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Lever Brothers. And that's how the ""soap"" opera got its name ..."
_XS,"RXS.    	There seems to some uncertainty about the origin of the symbol ""Rx"" that's used for a medical prescription. One explanation is that it comes from the astrological sign for Jupiter, a symbol put on prescriptions in days of old to invoke Jupiter's blessing to help a patient recover."

The outfit became known as 'the Bloomer Costume' and the pants were termed 'Bloomers', a word we use to this day."
AKI_BO,"AKIMBO.    	Akimbo is such a lovely word, I think (as in 'arms akimbo'). I failed to dig up anything too exciting about the term's etymology. It seems to stem from Middle English, ""in kekbowe"" or ""on kenbow"" meaning ""bend in a curve""."

TE_SE,"TERSE.    	I have never tweeted in my life, and have no plans to do so. Twitter is a micro-blogging service that limits any post sent to just 140 characters. In a sense, it is similar to this blog. Here I send out a post once a day containing information that I think might be useful to folks (thank you for reading!). I don't think I could send out much of interest using just 140 characters. I believe that many people who do tweet tend to send out messages like ""I'm at dinner now. I am having sushi"" and ""There's nothing on TV. I'm bored"". Nope, I don't think so!"
ONZ_,ONZE.    	'Onze' is French for 'eleven'.
SEU_AT,"SEURAT.    	Georges Seurat was a French Post-Impressionist.

HEM_N,"HE-MEN.    	If ever there was a movie that defines a career breakthrough for an actor, it would have to be ""Rocky"" for Sylvester Stallone. Stallone was a struggling actor in 1975 when a Muhammad Ali fight inspired Stallone to write a screenplay for a boxing movie, which he did in just three days. His efforts to sell the script went well but for the fact that the interested studios wanted a big name for the lead role, and Stallone was determined to be the star himself. Stallone persevered and ""Rocky"" was eventually made with him playing title role of Rocky Balboa. The movie won three Oscars, and ""Sly"" Stallone had arrived ..."

""Pleb"" is a shortened version of plebeian, and is a term used outside of the military schools to mean ""commoner""."
ON_G,"ONE G.    	The force of gravity that we all feel is referred to as 'one G'. As gravity is a actually an accelerating force, acceleration is measured relative to that force of gravity.

Zero-G is weightlessness that is experienced when in space, outside the influence of the earth's gravity."

Several years later he wrested sufficient power from the Roman Senate to end the Republic and begin the Roman Empire. As the first Emperor of Rome, Octavian was given the name Caesar Augustus. The month of August, originally called 'Sextilis' in Latin, was renamed in honor of Augustus."

MAND_,"M AND M.    	Forrest Mars, Sr. was the founder of the Mars Company. Forrest invented the Mars Bar while living over in England and then developed M&M's when he returned to the US. Mars came up with the idea for M&M's when he saw soldiers in the Spanish Civil War eating chocolate pellets. Those pellets had a hard shell of tempered chocolate on the outside to prevent them from melting. Mars got some of the funding to develop the M&M from William Murrie, the son of the president of Hershey's Chocolate.

HEI_Z,"HEINZ.    	The HJ Heinz Company is an American concern, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The company was founded in 1869, by Henry John Heinz. It was Heinz himself who came up with the marketing slogan of '57 Varieties'.

AD_D,"ADHD.    	The ""official"" name for the condition we sometimes still refer to as ""attention deficit disorder"" (ADD) is ""attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder"" (ADHD)."
E_LE,"EHLE.    	My favorite screen version of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the 1995 miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. The wonderful chemistry that Ehle and Firth exhibited on screen extended off the screen and the pair were 'an item' for a while.

_CETEN,"ACE-TEN.    	The game of ""twenty-one"" was first referred to in a book by Cervantes, the author famous for writing ""Don Quixote"". He called the game ""ventiuna"" (Spanish for ""twenty-one""). Cervantes wrote his story just after the year 1600, so the game has been around at least since then. Twenty-one came to the US but it wasn't all that popular so bonus payments were introduced to create more interest. One of the more attractive bonuses was a ten-to-one payout to a player who was dealt an ace of spades and a black jack. This bonus led to the game adopting the moniker ""Blackjack""."
SIT_A,"SITKA.    	The city of Sitka is located on Baranof Island and part of Chichagof Island in the Alaska Archipelago in the Pacific Ocean.

HAY_,"HAYS.    	The 1980 movie 'Airplane!' has to be one of the zaniest comedies ever made. The lead roles were Ted Striker (played by Robert Hays) and Elaine Dickinson (played by Julie Hagerty).

BOO_,"BOOP.    	Betty Boop made her first appearance on the screen in 1930, in a cartoon called ""Dizzy Dishes"". Her character was modeled on the the It-girl, the sexy Clara Bow of movie fame. Back then Betty Boop was a sexy poodle and it wasn't until 1932 that she morphed into completely human form. Betty was quite the risqué figure, but her vampish ways only lasted a few years.

L_MOS,"LIMOS.    	The word ""limousine"" actually derives from the French city of Limoges.

The ""fish"" in the film is the con artist Wanda, played by Curtis."

O_D,"ORD.    	O'Hare International is the fourth busiest airport in the world.
