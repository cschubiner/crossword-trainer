The title comes from the name of the subject, almost certainly Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Giocondo was a wealthy silk merchant in Florence who commissioned the painting for the couple's new home to celebrate the birth of their second son."
OLDI_,"OLDIE.    	Little Richard is the stage name of Richard Penniman, the self proclaimed 'architect of rock and roll'."

_AGOO,"MAGOO.    	Mr. Quincy Magoo is a wonderful cartoon character (I think) voiced by Jim Backus. Backus is probably equally well-known for playing Mr. Magoo as well as the role of Thurston Howell, III on ""Gilligan's Island"". Mr. Magoo first appeared on the screen in a short called ""The Ragtime Bear"" in 1949. His persona was at least in part based on the antics of W. C. Fields. Backus originally used a fake rubber nose that pinched his nostrils in order to create the distinctive voice, although in time he learned to do without the prop. My absolute favorite appearance by Mr. Magoo is in ""Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol"", a true classic from the sixties."
_ON,"SON.    	John Quincy Adams, the son of John Adams, was the 6th President. Like his father, John Quincy worked for many years as a diplomat representing the young United States.

LO_W,"LOEW.    	Marcus Loew was a New Yorker, born into a poor Jewish family. He started out in a penny arcade business and used its profits to buy into a nickelodeon.

After WWI, the Ottoman Empire had been defeated and the Allies occupied the Ottoman capital of Istanbul.

In the inevitable War of Independence that followed, the Turkish Nationalists used Ankara as their base. When they emerged victorious, they declared Ankara the new capital of Turkey."
_RF,"ARF.    	Chihuahua is a state in northern Mexico that shares a border with Texas and New Mexico. Chihuahua is the largest state in the country, so has the nickname ""El Estado Grande"".

When Capone was eventually put away for 11 years for tax evasion, Nitti was convicted of the same crime. Nitti was only imprisoned for 18 months, and when released he was labelled as the new head of Capone's Chicago Outfit. However the truth seems to be that he was just a frontman, with others making the decisions."
_IAA,RIAA.    	The Recording Industry of America (RIAA) represents music distributors. It is the RIAA that certifies records that have gone gold and platinum i.e. reached fixed sales thresholds. It's also the RIAA that goes after individuals who share music illegally online.

Such a nudge, a movement of the machine designed to influence the path taken by the ball, is called a ""tilt"". Most pinball machines have sensors designed to detect a tilt, and when activated a ""tilt"" warning light comes on and the player's controls are temporarily disabled."
GAR_,"GARP.    	John Irvine's 1978 novel ""The World According to Garp"" is somewhat biographical. In fact, Irvine's mother found parts of the novel difficult to read, recognizing elements of herself in Garp's mother."
_UEL,"AUEL.    	""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" is the first of a series of novels written by Jean Auel, set in prehistoric times.

Sounds interesting ..."

ALD_,"ALDO.    	I tried hard to enjoy the 2009 movie ""Inglourious Basterds"", but I find the violence in a Quentin Tarantino film so very hard to take. Brad Pitt plays the character, Lt, Aldo Raine. However, it got good reviews, so maybe you shouldn't let me put you off."

The most famous ragtime composer was Scott Joplin, who had a big hit with his ""Maple Leaf Rag"" when it was published in 1899. He followed that up with a string of hits, including the ""Pine Apple Rag"" (sic). Ragtime fell out of favor about 1917 when the public turned to jazz. It had a resurgence in the forties when jazz musicians started to include ragtime tunes in their repertoires. But it was the 1973 movie ""The Sting"" that brought the true revival, as the hit soundtrack included numerous ragtime tunes by Scott Joplin, including the celebrated ""The Entertainer"" originally published in 1902."

S_N,"SON.    	Back in the day, when reciting the alphabet it was common to emphasize that some letters could be used as a word in itself. One would say 'A per se A, B, C, D ... I per se I, J, K, L ... denoting that the letters A and I are also their own words. It was common to add the & symbol at the end of the recitation, as if it were a 27th letter. So the alphabet ended with 'X, Y, Z, & (and) per se and'. This 'and per se and' statement was slurred to 'ampersand', giving the name that we use today for the & symbol."
P_CE,"PACE.    	R.I.P. is actually an abbreviation for a Latin phrase, ""requiescat in pace"", which translates to ""may he rest in peace"". The commonly held belief that the acronym stands for the English ""rest in peace"" isn't quite correct, not completely anyway ..."

""Lassie Come Home"" was turned into a movie three years later, the first of a very successful franchise. The original Lassie was played by a dog called Pal, a male dog. In fact, all of the dogs that played Lassie over the years were males, because they looked better on camera, retaining a think coat even during the summer months."

Pearls of sago are simply little balls of sago starch used to make breads, pancakes, biscuits, or the steamed puddings that we ate as kids. Sago comes from pith of the sago palm tree. To get at the starch the tree has to be cut down and the trunk split to reveal the pith.

There is a relatively small amount of carbohydrate that is stored within the body's muscles, as glycogen. This glycogen can provide energy very quickly, right to the muscles where it is needed. Marathon runners often ""carb up"" before a race, eating a diet rich in carbohydrates for a few days before the event, so that the body's glycogen supplies are maximized."
RI_T,"RITT.    	Martin Ritt is best remembered as a television and movie director. During the bad old days of the ""Red Scare"", Ritt was working in television until he found himself on a blacklist for supposed support of Communist causes.

Usenet definitely played a significant part in the history of the Internet. For instance, the terms 'FAQ' and 'spam' were both born on Usenet."

AC_W,"A COW.    	Oh my goodness, my kids just loved Thomas the Tank Engine. The television show is based on the series of books by the Reverend W. V. Awdry and his son. The TV series was remarkable in that it attracted some celebrity narrators, the first being Ringo Starr. I think American audiences might have been more familiar with George Carlin, and then Alec Baldwin. Pierce Brosnan also had a go, narrating a TV special. I remember being on a flight one time with Ringo Starr (we didn't sit together!). When I told our kids' babysitter a few days later about my celebrity encounter she was marginally impressed although I had to explain that he was the drummer for the Beatles. When I added that Ringo was also the narrator for the ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" show, she nearly fainted with excitement. A generation gap ..."

The institute was set up in 1945 with funds from the charitable foundation of Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Charles F. Kettering was an executive at General Motors at the time, and he organized the application of industrial research techniques to the fight against cancer. Sloan and Kettering jointly announced the founding of the institute in the days following the dropping of the first atom bomb on Hiroshima. The pair pointed out that if a two billion dollar scientific effort could produce an atomic bomb, then surely a similar application of funds and scientific talent could make enormous strides in the fight against cancer."
_POS,"IPOS.    	An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the very first offer of stock for sale by a company on the open market. In other words, an IPO marks the first time that a company is traded on a public exchange. Companies have an IPO to raise capital to expand (usually)."

Notre Dame is home to many beautiful and significant artifacts, the most famous of which is the Crown of Thorns supposedly worn by Jesus Christ at his execution, which was placed in the cathedral in 1239. It's also home to some magnificent gargoyles on the roof, and you can climb up to the roof and take a very close look at them."
US_,"USC.    	The University of South Carolina's sports teams have gone by the moniker 'Gamecocks' since about 1900. The name was chosen in honor of a South Carolina revolutionary war hero named Thomas Sumter.

ABO_B,"A-BOMB.    	There are two classes of nuclear weapons, both of which get the energy for an explosion from nuclear reactions. The first nuclear bombs developed, called atomic bombs (A-bombs), use fission reactions. Uranium nuclei are split into smaller nuclei with the release of an awful lot of energy in the process. The second class of nuclear weapons are fusion bombs. These devices are called thermonuclear weapons or hydrogen bombs (H-bombs). In a fusion reaction, the nuclei of hydrogen isotopes are fused together to form bigger nuclei, with the release of even greater amounts of energy."
NAT_L,"NATAL.    	""Natal"" comes from the Latin word ""natalis"" meaning ""pertaining to birth""."
_EEDS,"LEEDS.    	I went to school not far from Leeds, in West Yorkshire in the north of England. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, Leeds was a major center for the production and trading of wool, and then with the onset mechanization it became a natural hub for manufacture of textiles."
_NKARA,"ANKARA.    	Ankara is the second largest city in Turkey, after Istanbul (formerly Constantinople). After WWI, the Ottoman Empire had been defeated and the Allies occupied the Ottoman capital of Istanbul.

In the inevitable War of Independence that followed, the Turkish Nationalists used Ankara as their base. When the Nationalists emerged victorious, they declared Ankara the new capital of Turkey."
NIS_,"NISI.    	Antonio Vivaldi was one of the great composers of the Baroque period. Vivaldi achieved fame and success within in his own lifetime, notoriety that faded soon after he died.

WKR_,"WKRP.    	The sitcom ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" was an MTM production, the company established by Mary Tyler Moore and her husband to produce ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". ""WKRP"" was a successful show when originally aired, but then became a blockbuster in syndication. It became MTM's most watched program, even outstripping the original ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""."
SO_E,"SOLE.    	Dover sole is the name given to two different species of flatfish. The common sole found in the Atlantic is called ""Dover sole"" in Europe, taking its names from the fishing port of Dover on the English coast where a lot of the fish was landed. The second species found in the Pacific is known as ""Dover sole"" on the Pacific coast of America. The Pacific species is called ""Dover sole"" just because it resembles the European species."
PA_LO,PAOLO.    	Paolo Veronese was a Renaissance painter from the Italian city of Verona (hence his name 'Veronese'). Veronese is most famous for his paintings 'The Wedding at Cana' and 'The Feast at the House of Levi'.

JOH_,"JOHN.    	The use of ""john"" as a slang term for a toilet is peculiar to North America. It probably comes from the older slang term of ""jack"" or ""jakes"" that had been around since the 16th century. In Ireland, in cruder moments, we still refer to a toilet as ""the jacks""."
U_ULA,"UVULA.    	The uvula is that conical, fleshy projection hanging down at the back of the soft palate. It plays an important role in human speech, particularly in the making of ""guttural"" sounds. The Latin word from grape is ""uva"", so ""uvula"" is a ""little grape""."

It's a coaster of thirds: the third fastest, and third highest in the world. It is somewhat notorious as a ride that can't cope with ""larger guests"". There's actually a test seat set up at the front of the park so that potential riders can check if they fit into the tight restraints ahead of time, so that they know not to join the long lines."
_OR,"MOR.    	Morocco is lies just 9 miles south of Spain, across the Straits of Gibraltar in the Mediterranean Sea."
I_S,"ILS.    	""Ils"" is the French for ""they"", when not referring to feminine nouns."
OR_OLES,"ORIOLES.    	The Baltimore Orioles was one of the eight charter teams of MLB's American League, so the franchise dates back to 1901. Prior to 1901, the team has roots in the Minor League Milwaukee Brewers, and indeed entered the American League as the Brewers. In 1902 the Brewers moved to St. Louis and became the Browns. The team didn't fare well in St. Louis, so when it finally relocated to Baltimore in the early fifties the team changed its name completely, to the Baltimore Orioles. The owners so badly wanted a fresh start that they traded 17 old Browns players with the New York Yankees. The trade didn't help the team's performance on the field in those early days, but it did help distance the new team from its past."
YE_R,"YEAR.    	The designations Anno Domini (AD, 'year of Our Lord') and Before Christ (BC) are found in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The dividing point between AD and BC is the year of the conception of Jesus, with AD 1 following 1 BC without a year '0' in between. The AD/BC scheme dates back to AD 525, and gained wide acceptance soon after AD 800. Nowadays a modified version has become popular, with CE (Common/Christian Era) used to replace AD, and BCE (Before the Common/Christian Era) used to replace BC."
NOK_A,"NOKIA.    	I do enjoy classical guitar music, but there isn't a huge choice on CD. There is one very special piece, Gran Vals by Francisco Tárrega, written in 1902.

Just a few bars into the work one can hear the omnipresent Nokia ring tone."
MASS_,"MASSE.    	In billiards, a massé shot is one in which the cue ball makes an extreme curve due to the player imparting heavy spin on the ball with his or her cue."
IT_H,"ITCH.    	""The Seven Year Itch"" is a 1955 movie by Billy Wilder, based on a stage play of the same name by George Axelrod. It stars Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell (as the guy with ""the itch""). Perhaps the most famous scene in the film is the one with Monroe standing over a subway grate allowing the updraft to billow the skirt of her white dress above her knees. It was meant to cool her down, but I think it had the opposite effect on some in the audience! The phrase ""seven year itch"" had been used by psychologists to describe declining interest in staying monogamous after seven years of marriage."
MAT_,"MATT.    	Matt Drudge came to fame along with the website he founded called the 'Drudge Report'. The 'Drudge Report' is a news aggregation site, mainly made up of links to stories published by the world media.

Phillips used her game as a tool to explain the single tax theory of American economist Henry George. The Landlord's Game was first produced commercially in 1924. The incredibly successful derivative game called Monopoly was introduced in 1933 by Charles Darrow, who became a very rich man when Parker Brothers bought the rights to the game just two years later in 1935."

_KY,"SKY.    	The zeppelin airship was developed by the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the design of which was granted a US patent in 1899. When zeppelins went into service, they were operated by the company Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG (DELAG), making that company the world's first commercial airline. DELAG was operating commercial flights even before WWI. Famously, that big spire at the top of the Empire State Building was designed to be a docking point for zeppelin airships. However, after several attempts to use it as such, the idea was abandoned as the updrafts coming up from the streets below made docking too hazardous a maneuver."
SISTI_E,"SISTINE.    	The 'Sistine Madonna' is a painting created by the Italian artist Raphael in 1513-1514. The work was commissioned by the Benedictine monks of the Monastery of San Sisto in northen Italy, hence the painting's name."

RWAND_,"RWANDA.    	Rwanda is a sovereign nation in central Africa that is populated by three groups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Tutsi are the second largest population of people in Rwanda, with the Hutu being the largest group. The bloody conflict that has existed between the Tutsi and Hutu peoples dates back to about 1880 when Catholic missionaries arrived in the region. The missionaries found that they had more success converting the Hutus than the Tutsi, and when the Germans occupied the area during WWI they confiscated Tutsi land and gave it to Hutu tribes in order to reward religious conversion. This injustice fuels fighting to this very day."
_LATO,"PLATO.    	Plato was a Greek philosopher and mathematician. He was a student of the equally famous and respected Socrates, and Plato in turn was the teacher and mentor of the celebrated Aristotle."

It was introduced in 1913 in response to a number of financial panics at the beginning of the 20th century. The original role for the Fed was to act as a lender of last resort, in case there was a run on a bank. This can happen as most of the money that is deposited by customers in a bank is reinvested by that bank, so it has very little liquid cash available. If too many customers look for their money at one time, then the bank can be short of cash and this can start a ""run"". The Fed's responsibilities have broadened since those early days."
ARYA_,"ARYAN.    	The Indo-Aryans are a collection of peoples that speak languages that share the same linguistic roots, traced back to the ancient Indo-Iranian peoples. Included inthe Indo-Aryan group of peoples are the Bengali people, the Gurkhas, the Kashmiri people and the Punjabi people."

When Jules Rimet, the president of soccer's international governing body decided to start an international tournament outside of the Olympics, it was decided to give Uruguay the honor of hosting the first competition, in 1930. Sure enough, Uruguay emerged victorious as the first World Cup winners. Sadly, Uruguay haven't won since."

SO_P,"SOUP.    	A traditional bisque is a creamy soup made from crustaceans such as lobster, crab or shrimp. The term 'bisque' probably comes from the Bay of 'Biscay' off the west coast of France, a nod to the French origin of the soup and its seafood content. So, if you see a vegetable 'bisque' in a restaurant, you'll know that the term is being misused ..."
_AL,"KAL.    	Indian-American actor Kal Penn made a name for himself in the ""Harold & Kumar"" series of comedy films. These so called ""stoner comedies"" are not my cup of tea, but I enjoyed him playing his more mainstream roles on TV's ""House"" and ""24"". While Penn's career was just taking off, he left the world of acting when President Obama won the 2008 election and now works as an Associate Director in the White House Office of Public Engagement (although he did leave the White House briefly to film the ""Harold & Kumar"" sequel)."

RA_T,"RANT.    	A jeremiad is a work of literature, sometime poetic but mainly prose. The tone of the piece is always that of a bitter lament, as the author derides the state of society and predicts it's downfall.

J_EG,"JPEG.    	An image file on a computer can be compressed so that it takes up less space. Some time the compression is ""lossless"" meaning even though the file is compressed, and data it is discarded, the image still looks the same. One example of data that can be discarded without loss of quality, is to not bother recording the color information of pixels that are the same color as others. Just saying ""this pixel is the same is that one"" takes up less space. One can compress files even more if one allows loss of quality. One well known compression algorithm that is ""lossy"" is the jpeg format. The person compressing the file can decide how much quality will suffer in jpeg format, with larger files being of higher quality than the smaller ones."
SAG_,"SAGA.    	A rune is a character in an alphabet that is believed to have mysterious powers. In Norse mythology, the runic alphabet was said to have a divine origin."

RO_S,"ROIS.    	Gateau des rois (French for ""cake of the kings"") is associated with Mardi Gras and Carnival in some places, and with an Epiphany festival just after Christmas in others. The kings referred to in the name of the cake are the three kings from the Bible, who came to honor the Christ Child, twelve days after he was born.

He was killed in the Battle of the Falkland Islands (the original 1914 version!). Of course he gave his name to the powerful pocket battleship, the Admiral Graf Spee, which was damaged in the Battle of the River Plate during WWII. The Graf Spee took refuge in the neutral port of Montevideo and when the boat was expelled by the government of Uruguay, the captain scuttled her rather than face the Allied flotilla waiting for her just outside the port."

LAS_R,"LASER.    	The key features of a laser printer are that it uses plain paper, and produces quality text at high speed. Laser printers work by projecting a laser image of the printed page onto a rotating drum, coated with photoconductors (material that becomes conductive when exposed to light). The part of the drum exposed to the laser carries a different charge than the unexposed areas. Dry ink (called toner) sticks to the unexposed areas due to electrostatic charge. The toner is transferred to paper by contact and is fused to the paper with heat. So, that explains why paper coming out of a laser printer is warm, and sometimes powdery ..."

M_GOO,"MAGOO.    	Mr. Quincy Magoo is a wonderful cartoon character voiced by Jim Backus. Backus is probably equally well-known for playing Mr. Magoo as well as Thurston Howell, III on ""Gilligan's Island"". Mr. Magoo first appeared on the screen in a short called ""The Ragtime Bear"" in 1949. His persona was at least in part based on the antics of W. C. Fields. Backus originally used a fake rubber nose that pinched his nostrils in order to create the distinctive voice, although in time he learned to do the voice without the prop. My absolute favorite appearance by Mr. Magoo is in ""Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol"", a true classic from the sixties. There was a movie adaptation of ""Mr Magoo"" released in 1997, with Leslie Nielsen playing the title role."

One example of data that can be discarded without loss of quality is to not bother recording the color information of pixels that are the same color as others. Just saying ""this pixel is the same is that one"" takes up less space. One can compress files even more if one allows loss of quality. One well known compression algorithm that is ""lossy"" is the jpeg format. The person compressing the file can decide how much quality will suffer in jpeg format, with larger compressed files being of higher quality than the smaller ones."

He won the accolades of a whole country for that feat, and was awarded the Medal of Honor (for which Lindbergh was eligible, as an Army Reserve officer). His new-found fame brought tragedy to his door, however, when a kidnapper took his infant son from his home in East Amwell, New Jersey.
