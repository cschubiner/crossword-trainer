Chess champ Mikhail.   		3 letters,"TAL.    	Mikhail Tal was truly a chess legend. Tal holds the record for the longest unbeaten streak in competition chess. And the second longest winning streak, well, that was by Tal as well."
Cowardly Lion harasser.   		4 letters,"TOTO.    	Toto is Dorothy's dog in the film 'The Wizard of Oz', and in the original book 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' by L. Frank Baum.

Smooth operator.   		4 letters,"ROUE.    	""Roue"" is a lovely word, I think, describing a less then lovely man. He could otherwise be described as a cad, someone of loose morals. It comes from the French word ""rouer"" meaning ""to break on a wheel"". This describes the ancient form of capital punishment where a poor soul was lashed to a wheel and then beaten to death with cudgels and bars. I guess the suggestion is that a ""roue"" with his loose morals deserves such a punishment."
Canon element.   		5 letters,"TENET.    	A tenet is an article of faith, something that is held to be true. 'Tenet' is Latin for 'he holds'."
