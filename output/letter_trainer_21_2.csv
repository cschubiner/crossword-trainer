""Djinns"" were various spirits considered lesser than angels, people who exhibit unsavory characteristics could be said to be possessed by djinn. When the book ""The Thousand and One Nights"" was translated into French, the word ""djinn"" was transformed into ""génie"", because of the similarity in sound and the related spiritual meaning. This ""génie"" from the Arabian tale became confused with the Latin-derived ""genie"". The Latin ""genius"" was a guardian spirit thought to be assigned to each person at birth. Purely as a result of that translation the word genie has come to mean the ""djinn"" that pops out of the bottle. Quite interesting ..."

N_TTI,"NITTI.    	Frank Nitti was one of the top henchmen working for Al Capone. Unlike Capone, who was born in Brooklyn, New York, Nitti was actually born in Italy, near the city of Salerno. When Capone was eventually put away for 11 years for tax evasion, Netti was convicted of the same crime. Nitti was only imprisoned for 18 months, and when released he was labelled as the new head of Capone's Chicago Outfit. However the truth seems to be that he was just a front man, with others making the decisions."

Compared to other Disney feature-length cartoons, ""Lilo & Stitch"" was relatively cheaply produced, using the voices of lesser-known actors.

The term comes from the flightless bird called the kiwi, which is endemic to New Zealand and is the country's national symbol. ""Kiwi"" is a Maori word, and the plural (when referring to the bird) is simply ""kiwi"". However, when you have two or more New Zealanders with you, they are Kiwis (note the ""s"", and indeed the capital ""K""!)."

The remake came out in 2004, and starred Jude Law in the title role. The theme song was performed by Cher in the 1966 movie. However, it was Dionne Warwick's cover version from 1967 that was the most successful in the charts."

This was replaced with a sequence using a spaceship instead, as the producers were sensitive to public sentiment after the September 11 attacks."
STA_,"STAX.    	Booker T. & the M.G.'s were in effect the house band at Stax Records, and so appeared on loads of famous recordings, including some by Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding.
