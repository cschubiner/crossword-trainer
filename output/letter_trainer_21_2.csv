""Djinns"" were various spirits considered lesser than angels, people who exhibit unsavory characteristics could be said to be possessed by djinn. When the book ""The Thousand and One Nights"" was translated into French, the word ""djinn"" was transformed into ""g√©nie"", because of the similarity in sound and the related spiritual meaning. This ""g√©nie"" from the Arabian tale became confused with the Latin-derived ""genie"". The Latin ""genius"" was a guardian spirit thought to be assigned to each person at birth. Purely as a result of that translation the word genie has come to mean the ""djinn"" that pops out of the bottle. Quite interesting ..."

When Capone was eventually put away for 11 years for tax evasion, Netti was convicted of the same crime.

Compared to other Disney feature-length cartoons, ""Lilo & Stitch"" was relatively cheaply produced, using the voices of lesser-known actors.
