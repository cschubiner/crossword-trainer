SALIER_,"SALIERI.    	If you've seen the brilliant 1984 movie ""Amadeus"", you'll have seen Salieri portrayed as being very envious and resentful of the gifted Mozart. It is no doubt true that two composers fought against each other, at least on occasion, but the extent of the acrimony between the two has perhaps been exaggerated in the interest of theater. Mozart and his wife had six children, but only two survived infancy. The youngest boy was called Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart, born just five months before his father died. Franz was to become a gifted composer, teacher, pianist and conductor, helped along the way by lessons from his father's supposed rival, Antonio Salieri."

Amalie's father left his wife and five children when she was 17, and moved from Norway to the US to avoid a prison term.

The base is the oldest overseas base operated by the navy, and dates back to the Cuban-American Treaty of 1903, at which time the US leased the facility as a fueling station.

LI_HO,"LITHO.    	Lithography is a printing technique that was invented in 1796 as a cheap way to publish theatrical works. In the litho process the image is drawn on a metal plate, although originally it was drawn on a stone (hence the prefix 'litho-').

WAI_E,"WAITE.    	Ralph Waite played the Dad, John Walton Sr. on ""The Waltons"". I was never much of a John-Boy fan, but I did like ""Roots"". Waite played a very different character on that show, first mate on the slave ship ""Slater""."

The first real contact lenses were developed by Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick, a German ophthalmologist, in 1887."

It has always been a favorite of mine, since the days I used to watch episodes of ""The Lone Ranger"" at the cinema on a Saturday morning as a kid. More recently it has gained notoriety in a Honda advertising stunt. If you drive at a steady speed of 55 mph down a road near Lancaster, California, grooves cut in the road surface interact with the car's tires to create the sound of the main ""William Tell"" theme."
AZAR_A,"AZARIA.    	I can't stand ""The Simpsons"" but I so love to watch Hank Azaria perform.

When the Greeks came to occupy Egypt, the word they used as a translation for Pesedjet was ENNEAD, Greek for ""the nine"".

AB_OLUT,"ABSOLUT.    	I must admit, if I ever do order a vodka drink by name, I will order the Absolut brand.

As the value in the US was greater than that in Italy, he could make a handsome profit.

S_OMA,"STOMA.    	Stomata (the usual plural of stoma, not 'stomas') are pores found under almost every leaf, clearly visible under a simple microscope. The stomata take in air rich in carbon dioxide. Through the process of photosynthesis, the plants generate oxygen, which is released back into the air though the same stomata."
B_WELVE,"B-TWELVE.    	Vitamin B12 is a water soluble vitamin that plays a role in the function of the brain and the nervous system. Folks like me who don't eat any animal foods have to watch out for vitamin B12 as it is the one food substance that isn't readily available from plant sources. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria readily found in ""dirt"" so it is readily ingested by animals and passed onto humans via diary products or meat. As we have to be so careful about washing our vegetables because of the use of pesticides, humans aren't readily exposed to vitamin B12 when eating vegetables, so vegans often take supplements. Personally, as a potato-eating Irishman who always eats the skins of the potato, and doesn't wash them too much when they come in from the garden, I've always had loads of B12 in my blood when it has been tested, without any supplements. I guess the message is ""eat dirt"" ..."
_RO,"GRO.    	Scotts Miracle-Gro Company was founded in 1868 by one Orlando Scott, initially selling seed to the agricultural industry. In the early 1900s, Scotts started to sell to homeowners, mainly supplying lawn seed. The company merged with the gardening company Miracle-Gro in 1955."
BA_ANAS,"BANANAS.    	Woody Allen's 1971 comedy ""Bananas"" stars Allen in the lead role. It's about an American blue collar guy who heads to a Cuba-style republic in the midst of a revolution, all to impress a girl (played by Louise Lasser). The ""Bananas"" is meant to denote the craziness of the Allen character, but it's also a pun on the term ""Banana Republic""."
_FS,EFS.    	There are three letters F (efs) in the word 'fluffy'.
_LEG,"A LEG.    	John Mellencamp started to use the stage name Johny Cougar in 1976, a name that evolved into John Cougar, and then to John Cougar Mellencamp in the eighties. In 1992 the ""Cougar"" was dropped altogether and Mellencamp has been performing under his own name since then. Mellencamp was married to former supermodel Elaine Irwin for eighteen years, but the two recently decided to split. Mellencamp's new girlfriend is actress Meg Ryan."

He was of the House of Normandy and was the fourth son of William I (William the Conqueror, of Battle of Hastings fame). Henry succeeded to the throne of England after his elder brother, William II, was shot with an arrow while hunting, apparently by accident."
C_SE,"CASE.    	The word ""sleuth"" came into English from Old Norse as far back as 1200 when it meant the ""track or trail of a person"". In the mid-1800s, a sleuthhound described a keen investigator, a hound close on the trail of the suspect. Sleuthhound was shortened to ""sleuth"" and was used for a detective in general."
_NY,"ANY.    	""Knock on Any Door"" was a novel by Willard Motley before being adapted for the solver screen in 1949. The move was produced by a new company called Santana Productions, partly owned by Humphrey Bogart himself. Santana was the name of Bogart's private yacht."
DOSI_O,"DO-SI-DO.    	The term do-si-do is actually a corruption of a French phrase ""dos-a-dos"", meaning back-to-back. And parenthetically, this is just the opposite to the familiar French term ""vis-a-vis"", meaning face-to-face. In the dance move, the partners start facing each other, then advance past each other's right shoulder, and then move to the right without turning so that they are now facing away from each other (back-to-back). They complete the move facing in the same directing, passing each other's left shoulders by moving backwards until they return to the starting position."
HA_EK,"HAYEK.    	Salma Hayek is a Mexican actress, the first Mexican national to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, for her portrayal of painter Frida Kahlo in the 2002 movie ""Frida""."
ENTO_,"ENTOM.    	Entomology is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of insects. The etymology of entomology (!) is the Greek ""entomon"" (meaning ""insect"") and ""logia"" (meaning ""study of""). In turn, the Greek word ""entomos"" for insect is literal translation into Greek of ""having a notch or cut"", in deference to the observation by Aristotle that insects have segmented bodies."
_LEDS,"SLEDS.    	The skeleton is a small sled for only one person, on which the rider lies face-down and goes down the hill head-first. The skeleton can be compared to the luge, a sled used by one or two people and on which the rider(s) lies face-up and feet-first."
STR_AK,"STREAK.    	People have been running around naked for an awfully long time, but the application of the word 'streaking' to the phenomenon only dates back to 1973. A journalist was reporting on a mass nude run of 533 people at the University of Maryland in 1973, and used the words 'they are streaking (i.e. moving quickly) past me right now. It's an incredible sight!'. The Associated Press picked up the story the next day, and interpreting 'streaking' as the term to describe 'running naked', and we've been using it that way ever since."
_HEATRE,"THEATRE.    	""Masterpiece Theatre"" has changed its name, you may have noticed, and is now just called ""Masterpiece"". I of course love the show, because it gives me an opportunity to see great BBC productions, the stuff on which I was raised. The first airing of the show on PBS was In 1971, and the first production was the wonderful BBC mini-series ""The First Churchills"" starring Susan Hampshire (highly recommended for lovers of period drama)."

_AGEN,"HAGEN.    	Tom Hagen was portrayed by Robert Duvall in ""The Godfather"" movies. Hagen wasn't an Italian-American, but rather of German-Irish descent. Duvall was slated to appear in the role in ""The Godfather, Part III"" but the character was written out of the script when Duvall was deemed to have asked for too much money."
_ATYRS,"SATYRS.    	The satyrs of Greek mythology came with a very high sex drive. They are the ""rude"" male subjects drawn on the side of old Greek vases. The nubile maidens known as nymphs were often an object of attention for the satyrs."

A_RILS,"APRILS.    	April Fool's Day is celebrated on April 1st in the western world. In the US (and Ireland) one can make practical jokes all day long if one wants. But, in the UK, there is a noon deadline. Anyone pranking after midday is called an ""April Fool""."
_ATO,"SATO.    	Prime Minister Eisaku Sato of Japan won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974 (sharing it with Irishman Sean MacBride). He won for ""his renunciation of the nuclear option for Japan and his efforts to further regional reconciliation"". Sato defined Japan's nuclear policy in the sixties by laying out ""Three Non-Nuclear Principles"". The principles are that Japan will not possess, nor manufacture nuclear weapons, nor permit introduction of nuclear weapons into Japanese territory."
LEGE_,"LEGER.    	Fernand Leger was a French painter, and among his works was a series of paintings called ""La Grande Parade"". I quite like his ""Still Life with Beer Mug"", painted in 1921. Anything with beer ..."
