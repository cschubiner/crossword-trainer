The octane rating is measure of the resistance of the gasoline to auto-ignition i.e. its resistance to ignition just by virtue of being compressed in the cylinder.

BL_U,"BLEU.    	Being a bit of a French speaker (admittedly a pretty poor one), the term ""bleu"" cheese has always kind of irritated me. I would prefer that we use either ""blue cheese"" or ""fromage bleu"" and not mix the languages, but then I can be annoyingly picky! It's said that blue cheese was probably discovered accidentally, as molds tend to develop in the same conditions that are best for storing cheese. The blue mold in the cheese is introduced by adding Penicillium spores before the cheese is allowed to set. And yes, it's the same mold that is used to produce penicillin, the antibiotic."
_LYSE,"ELYSE.    	The actress Meredith Baxter is best known for playing the mother (Elyse) in the eighties sitcom 'Family Ties'.

_AIKU,"HAIKU.    	A haiku is a very elegant form of Japanese verse. When writing a haiku in English we tend to impose the rule that the verse must contain 17 syllables. This restriction comes from the rule in Japanese that the verse must contain 17 sound units called ""moras"", but moras and syllables aren't the same thing. What the difference is though, is not so clear to me. Here's a rather humorous example of a Haiku:"

Malta played a crucial role for the Allies during WWII as it was located very close to the Axis shipping lanes in the Mediterranean. The Siege of Malta lasted from 1940 to 1942, a prolonged attack by the Italians and Germans on the RAF and Royal Navy, and the people of Malta.

GIG_,"GIGI.    	In the lovely musical film ""Gigi"", released in 1958, the title song is sung by Louis Jourdan who plays Gaston. My favorite number though, has to be ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls"" sung by Maurice Chevalier. Many say that 'Gigi' is the last in the long line of great MGM musicals. It won a record 9 Academy Awards, a record that only lasted one year. Twelve months later 'Ben Hur' won 11 Oscars. In the 1958 film, Gigi was played by the lovely Leslie Caron. A few years earlier, 'Gigi' was a successful stage play on Broadway. Chosen for the title role on stage was the then-unknown Audrey Hepburn."

The trio first appeared in an ad campaign in 1933, although the phrase ""snap, crackle and pop"" had been used for the cereal for some time in radio ads. By the way, the elves are selling ""Rice Bubbles"" in Australia, and the elves have different names in other parts of the world (like ""Cric!, Crac! and Croc! in Quebec)."

K_DD,"KIDD.    	William Kidd was a Scottish privateer who went by the name 'Captain Kidd'. Although Kidd was a privateer, someone authorized by the government to attack foreign shipping, he was eventually arrested and executed for piracy. There is common opinion held today that the charges against Kidd were actually trumped up.

"T.N_G.""","T.N.G."".    	When Gene Roddenberry was creating the 'Star Trek' spin-off series 'Star Trek: The Next Generation', I think he chose a quite magnificent name for the new starship captain. The name ""Jean-Luc Picard"" is imitative of one or both of the twin-brother Swiss scientists Auguste and Jean Felix Piccard. The role of Picard was of course played by the wonderful Shakespearean actor Patrick Stewart."

_OCA,"BOCA.    	The name of the city of Boca Raton in Florida translates from Spanish as 'Mouse Mouth'.

_FTS,"EFTS.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants.

After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs.

Although ""Lolita"" is considered a classic today, after Nabokov finished it in 1953 the edgy subject matter made it impossible for him to find a publisher in the US (where Nabokov lived). In 1955, he resorted to publishing it in English at a printing house in Paris. Publication was followed by bans and seizures all over Europe.

The Golden Delicious is now the official fruit of West Virginia."

Here in America the term is usually reserved for those practicing the law (both male and female).

Butler Esq."

The style became very popular with women in the early 1900s (as worn by actress Clara Bow, for example), with the fashion dying out in the thirties. The style reemerged in the sixties around the time the Beatles introduced their ""mop tops"", with Vidal Sassoon leading the way in styling women's hair in a bob cut again. Personally, I like it ..."

The contraction ""bos'n"" is also very popular."
H_IKU,"HAIKU.    	A haiku is a very elegant form of Japanese verse. When writing a haiku in English we tend to impose the rule that the verse must contain 17 syllables. This restriction comes from the rule in Japanese that the verse must contain 17 sound units called ""moras"", but moras and syllables aren't the same thing. What the difference is though, is not so clear to me. Here's an example of a Haiku:"
S_EEL,"STEEL.    	During WWII there was a shortage of copper, so the US Mint switched to zinc-coated steel for production of one-cent coins in 1943. The coins had all sorts of problems in circulation, so the mint had to change again for the 1944-46 production, using a brass/copper alloy. For obvious reasons, the 1943 coin is called a ""steelie"", and is the only coin ever issued by the US mint that can be picked up by a magnet."
OR_,"ORK.    	""Mork & Mindy"" was broadcast from 1978 to 1982. We were first introduced to Mork (played by Robin Williams) in a special episode of ""Happy Days"".

ETD_,ETDS.    	Estimated time of departure (ETD)
IN_Y,"INDY.    	""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is, in my humble opinion, the best of the Indiana Jones franchise of movies. This first Indiana Jones film was released in 1981, produced by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg. Harrison Ford was Spielberg's first choice to play the lead, but Lucas resisted as he was concerned that he would be too closely associated with the actor (as Ford played Han Solo in ""Star Wars"", and also appeared in Lucas's ""American Graffiti""). Tom Selleck was offered the role but couldn't get out of his commitments to ""Magnum, P.I."" Eventually Spielberg got his way, and that was a good thing I'd say ..."
X_CTO,"X-ACTO.    	The X-Acto knife was invented in the thirties by a Polish immigrant, although his intention was to come up with a scalpel for surgeons. The knife couldn't cut it as a scalpel though (pun intended!), because it was difficult to clean. The inventor's brother-in law suggested it be used as a craft knife, and it is still around today."
HE_RI,"HENRI.    	Henri Matisse was a French artist renowned for his contribution to modern art. In his early career, Matisse was classed as a ""fauve"", one of the group of artists known as the ""wild beasts"" who emphasized strong color over realism in their works. He was a lifelong friend of Pablo Picasso, and the two were considered to be good-natured rivals so their works are often compared. One major difference between their individual portfolios is that Picasso tended to paint from his imagination, whereas Matisse tended to use nature as his inspiration."
