You've probably seen the ads on television, with folks talking to their iPhones asking for information and responding with a voice. I hear that Google is a little scared by Siri, as Siri is non-visual. There's no need to touch a screen or a keyboard to work with Siri, no opportunity to click on one of Google's ads!

The British version of Siri is called Daniel, and the Australian version is called Karen. Also, 'Siri' is a Norwegian name meaning 'beautiful woman who leads you to victory', and was the name the developer had chosen for his first child."

When an organism is alive, the amount of radioactive carbon-14 it has compared to the amount of regular carbon-12, is a fixed ratio. After the organism dies, it is no longer exchanging carbon with the atmosphere through metabolism. So, the stable carbon-12 stays in the body as it rots but the radioactive carbon-14 gradually decays, causing the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 to fall. Scientists can determine the age of remains by measuring this carbon-14/carbon-12 ratio."
