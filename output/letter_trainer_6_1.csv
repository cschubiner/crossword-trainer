AE_,"AER.    	Aer Lingus is my favorite airline! Well, the service isn't that great, but when I get on board an Aer Lingus plane I feel like I am back in Ireland. Aer Lingus is the national airline of Ireland, with Aer Lingus being a phonetic spelling of the Irish ""aer-loingeas"" meaning ""air fleet"". These days Aer Lingus can only lay claim to the title of Ireland's oldest airline as it is no longer the biggest. That honor goes to the controversial budget airline, Ryan Air."

MI_,"MIR.    	Mir was a very successful project, with the station still holding the record for the longest continuous manned presence in space, at just under ten years. Towards the end of its life however, the years began to take their toll. There was a dangerous fire, multiple system failures, and a collision with a resupply ship. The Russian commitment to the International Space Station drained funds for repairs, so the station was allowed to reenter the Earth's atmosphere in 2001."
MI_,"MIR.    	The Russian Mir Space Station was a remarkably successful project, with the station still holding the record for the longest continuous manned presence in space, at just under ten years. Towards the end of the space station's life however, the years began to take their toll. There was a dangerous fire, multiple system failures, and a collision with a resupply ship. The Russian commitment to the International Space Station drained funds for repairs, so Mir was allowed to reenter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up in 2001."

E_S,"EMS.    	The first use of an emergency phone number nationally was in the UK in 1937, where the number 999 was introduced to call emergency services. If you need emergency services in the UK or Ireland to this day, you have to dial 999. It's not really clear why 911 became the emergency number in the US. The most credible suggestion (to me) is that when it was introduced by the FCC in 1967, it was a number that ""fit"" with the numbers already used by AT&T for free services (211-long distance; 411-information; 611-repair service)."
N_R,"NPR.    	Chicago Public Radio produces one of my favorite radio shows, ""Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!"" It is indeed a fun game show, hosted by Peter Sagal.

HAL stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer. Even though, Clarke denied it, there's a good argument that can be made that the acronym HAL is a veiled reference to IBM, the big player in the world of computing at the time of the novel's publication (1968). The acronym HAL is just a one-letter shift from the initials ""IBM""."

TW_,"TWA.    	Trans World Airlines (TWA) was a big carrier in the US, but was perhaps even more recognized for its extensive presence in Europe and the Middle East. For many years, especially after the collapse of Pan-Am, TWA was considered the unofficial flag carrier for the US. The company started in 1930, the product of a forced merger of Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express.

These days Aer Lingus can only lay claim to the title of Ireland's oldest airline as it's no longer the biggest. That honor goes to the controversial budget airline, Ryan Air."
CB_,"CBS.    	'Five-O' has become urban slang for a police officer, or the police force in general. The term is rooted in the 1970s TV Show ""Hawaii Five-O"".

Towards the end of the space station's life however, the years began to take their toll. There was a dangerous fire, multiple system failures, and a collision with a resupply ship.

_ESS,"TESS.    	The full name of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel is ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented"". When it was originally published, ""Tess"" received very mixed reviews, largely because it addressed some difficult sexual themes including rape, and sexual double standards (attitudes towards men vs women). I suppose the most celebrated screen adaption is Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" released in 1979. Polanski apparently made ""Tess"" because his wife, Sharon Tate, gave him Hardy's novel as her last act before she was murdered by the Manson family. There is a dedication at the beginning of the movie that just says ""To Sharon""."

He was urged by friends to open a cookie store (the cookies were that good, I guess) and this he did in Los Angeles in 1975, naming it ""Famous Amos"". The store was a smash hit, and he was able build on the success by introducing his cookies into supermarkets.
