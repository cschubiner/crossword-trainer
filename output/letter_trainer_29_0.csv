We are more likely to have learned about the photoelectric effect in school, in which electrons were ejected from the surface of some materials when it was exposed to light or other forms of radiation.

The guy says, ""About four dollars"" ..."

I would prefer that we use either ""blue cheese"" or ""fromage bleu"" and not mix the languages, but then I can be annoyingly picky! It's said that blue cheese was probably discovered accidentally, as molds tend to develop in the same conditions that are best for storing cheese.
