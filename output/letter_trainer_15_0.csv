AL_A,"ALIA.    	I find it a little odd that Queen Alia's name is used for an airport (the international airport in Amman, Jordan). Queen Alia was killed in a helicopter crash in 1977. Having said that, before she married King Hussein Alia did work for Royal Jordanian Airlines."
_RIEL,"ARIEL.    	Ariel is a spirit, a character who appears in William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' and who becomes a servant of the magician Prospero.

The signature song ""As Time Goes By"" was written many years earlier for a 1931 Broadway musical called ""Everybody's Welcome"", and was a hit in 1931 for Rudy Vallee. But today we all remember the Casablanca version, sung by Dooley Wilson (who played ""Sam"" in the film).

There followed a string of gangster roles played alongside De Niro, namely ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". But I like Pesci's comedic acting best of all. He was marvelous in the ""Home Alone"" films, the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and my personal favorite, ""My Cousin Vinny"". Pesci gets a mention in the stage musical ""Jersey Boys"", which isn't too surprising as he is one of the show's producers."

What is interesting about gar is that their swim bladders are vascularized so that they can actually function as lungs.

By 1935 his reputation as a ""character"" had grown, so much so that Governor Ruby Laffoon of Kentucky gave Sanders the honorary title of ""Kentucky Colonel"". Later in the fifties, Sanders developed his trademark look with the white suit, string tie, mustache and goatee. When Sanders was 65 however, his business failed and in stepped Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's. Thomas simplified the Sanders menu, cutting it back from over a hundred items to just fried chicken and salads. That was enough to launch KFC into the fast food business. Sanders sold the US franchise in 1964 for just $2 million and moved to Canada to grow KFC north of the border. He died in 1980 and is buried in Louisville, Kentucky. The Colonel's secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices is indeed a trade secret. Apparently there is only one copy of the recipe, a handwritten piece of paper, written in pencil and signed by Colonel Sanders. Since 2009, the piece of paper has been locked in a computerized vault surrounded with motion detectors and security cameras."

_DS,"YDS.    	We never used the word ""gridiron"" when I was growing up in Ireland (meaning a grill used for cooking food over an open fire).

K_C,"KFC.    	The famous ""Colonel"" of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame was Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur from Henryville, Indiana. Although not really a ""Colonel"", Sanders did indeed serve in the military. He enlisted in the Army as a private in 1906 at the age of 16, lying about his age. He spent the whole of his time in the Army as a soldier in Cuba. It was much later, in the 1930s, that Sanders went into the restaurant business making his specialty deep-fried chicken. By 1935 his reputation as a ""character"" had grown, so much so that Governor Ruby Laffoon of Kentucky gave Sanders the honorary title of ""Kentucky Colonel"". Later in the fifties, Sanders developed his trademark look with the white suit, string tie, mustache and goatee. When Sanders was 65 however, his business failed and in stepped Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's. Thomas simplified the Sanders menu, cutting it back from over a hundred items to just fried chicken and salads. That was enough to launch KFC into the fast food business. Sanders sold the US franchise in 1964 for just $2 million and moved to Canada to grow KFC north of the border. He died in 1980 and is buried in Louisville, Kentucky. The Colonel's secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices is indeed a trade secret. Apparently there is only one copy of the recipe, a handwritten piece of paper, written in pencil and signed by Colonel Sanders. Since 2009, the piece of paper has been locked in a computerized vault surrounded with motion detectors and security cameras."

_AN,"PAN.    	Pan was the god of shepherds in Greek mythology, and lived in the rustic surroundings of Arcadia."
G_ESE,"GEESE.    	Apparently geese fly in a V-formation for a couple of reasons. One is that it makes for efficient flight and conserves energy. The leading bird gets no advantage, but every following bird gets to ""slipstream"" a little. It has been noted that the lead bird drops to the back of the formation when it gets fatigued. It's also thought that the flock can stick together more easily when in formation, so it is more difficult to lose someone along the way."
