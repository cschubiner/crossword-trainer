One story is that it was taken from the Detroit Light Guard military unit who were known as ""The Tigers"".

He was very simple in his use of equipment. He was one of the first professionals to accept the 35mm camera, and mainly used a 'normal' 50 mm lens. He only shot in black-and-white, and never bothered with developing his own prints. He focused on taking the photograph."
C_AM,"CLAM.    	""Buck"" and ""clam"" are both slang terms for ""a dollar"". The term ""buck"" has been around at least since 1856, and is thought to derive from the tradition of using buckskin as a unit of trade with Native Americans during the frontier days.

Despite all Bob Dole's success in the world of politics, he is remembered by many as the VP candidate who lost to Walter Mondale (and Jimmy Carter) and the presidential candidate who lost to incumbent Bill Clinton.

In 1945 he was hit by machine gun fire in his right arm and back, so badly injured that his comrades could only dose him up with morphine, write ""M"" on his forehead with his own blood (so that another, fatal dose of morphine would not be administered) and continue fighting the battle.

There are many tales surrounding the writing of the story including one that the author wrote the basic tale in just three to six days, and spent a few weeks simply refining it. Allegedly, Stevenson's use of cocaine stimulated his creative juices during those few days of writing."
A_A,"ACA.    	The Mexican city sitting across the border from El Paso is more correctly called Ciudad Juarez. Juarez used to be called El Paso del Norte (the North Pass). It was to be the younger settlement on the northern side of the Rio Grande which would retain the ""El Paso"" name."

AMOEB_,"AMOEBA.    	An ameba (or ""amoeba"" as we spell it back in Ireland) is a single-celled microorganism. The name comes from the Greek ""amoibe"", meaning change. The name is quite apt, as the cell changes shape readily as the ameba moves, eats or reproduces."

""Eleni"" tells of his life in Greece during WWII and the Greek Civil War.

However, every 2-3 years, depending on the phase of the moon at the beginning of the calendar year, there may be a thirteenth full moon. The ""extra"" full moon is called a ""blue moon"", although no one seems to really know why as far as I can tell. Which of the thirteen full moons that is designated as the blue moon varies depending on tradition. My favorite definition is from the Farmer's Almanac. It states that as each of the seasons normally have three full moons (twelve divided by the four seasons), then the season with four full moons is designated as ""special"", then, the THIRD full moon in that ""special"" season is the blue moon. Complicated, huh?"
LAN_E,"LANCE.    	Tilting is the most recognized form of jousting. Jousting can involve the use of a number of different weapons, but when lances are used the competition is called ""tilting"". Jousting took place in a roped-off enclosure that was called the lists, or list field. In later medieval times, some castles and palaces had purpose-built ""tiltyards"" that were used for jousting. Do you remember where the Beach Volleyball events were held in the 2012 London Olympics? Well that was Horse Guards Parade, the former tiltyard for the Palace of Whitehall that was used in the time of King Henry VIII."
_AIKU,"HAIKU.    	A haiku is a very elegant form of Japanese verse. When writing a haiku in English we impose the rule that the verse must contain 17 syllables. This restriction comes from the rule in Japanese that the verse must contain 17 sound units called ""moras"", but moras and syllables aren't the same thing. What the difference is though, is not so clear to me ..."

PE_ER,"PETER.    	As is the case for many I am sure, Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"" was my introduction to the world of classical music, as it was played for us at school many, many moons ago.

She was a successful courtesan, notably moving in various circles of high-ranking military officers. She apparently worked as a double agent, both for the French and the Germans.

The title translates from Neapolitan into ""My Sun"" (and not into ""O, My Sun"" as one might expect).

From very early in the company's life it was the de facto representative air carrier of the United States.

EF_S,"EFTS.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals in the world. They are found all over the world, living on land or in the water depending on the species, but always associated with water, even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start of as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants, unlike the eggs of frogs and toads which float freely. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."
JE_I,"JEDI.    	The Jedi are the 'good guys' in the 'Star Wars' series of movies. The most famous Jedi knights from the films are Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Alec Guinness, and later Ewan McGregor) and Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz). Well, they're my favorites anyway ..."

In order to get pure metal from the ore, it is heated and the oxides reduced (i.e. the oxygen is removed) in the chemical process known as smelting.

PE_T,"PEAT.    	When dead plant matter accumulates in marshy areas, it may not fully decay due to a lack of oxygen or acidic conditions. We are familiar with this in Ireland, because what can form then is peat, and we have lots of peat bogs. If the peat bogs get covered over with sedimentary matter, then over time pressure and heat can dry out the peat forming a soft brown material called lignite. Given further heat and pressure, and time, this lignite converts to coal. So, lignite is a material with characteristics between peat and coal, and is often called ""brown coal""."

Most of the US gold reserves are in ""Fort Knox"", although it isn't the biggest gold repository in the US. That honor goes to the vault under the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Manhattan. Most of the gold stored in the New York vault belongs to foreign nations and banks."
