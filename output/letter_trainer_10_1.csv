EBO_,"EBON.    	Ebony is another word for the color black (often shortened to ""ebon"" in poetry). Ebony is a dark, black wood that is very dense, and is one of the few types of wood that sinks in water. Ebony has been in high demand, so the species of trees yielding the wood are now considered threatened. It's in such short supply, that unscrupulous vendors have been known to darken lighter woods with shoe polish, so be warned ..."
_GEE,"OGEE.    	An ogee is a type of S-curve. Specifically it is a figure consisting of two arcs that curve in opposite directions (like an S) but both ends of the curve end up parallel to each other (which is not necessarily true for an S).

ORSO_,"ORSON.    	""Citizen Kane"" was the first film made by Orson Welles, one considered by many to be the finest film ever made.

OPR_H,"OPRAH.    	What can you say about Oprah Winfrey? Born into poverty to a single mother and with a harrowing childhood, Oprah is now the greatest African American philanthropist the world has ever known.

Apparently folks had trouble pronouncing ""Orpah"", so she's now ""Oprah""."

SOH_,"SOHO.    	The Manhattan neighborhood known today as SoHo was very fashionable in the early 1900s, but as the well-heeled started to move uptown the area became very run down and poorly maintained. Noted for the number of fires that erupted in derelict buildings, SoHo earned the nickname ""Hell's Hundred Acres"". The area was then zoned for manufacturing and became home to many sweatshops. In the mid-1900s artists started to move into open loft spaces and renovating old buildings as the lofts were ideal locations in which an artist could both live and work. In 1968, artists and others organized themselves so that they could legalize their residential use of an area zoned for manufacturing. The group they formed took its name from the name given to the area by the city's Planning Commission i.e ""South of Houston"". This was shortened from So-uth of Ho-uston to SoHo as in the SoHo Artists Association, and the name stuck."

She was 17 when she appeared in the 1972 Munich Games, and had been training in a sports school since she was 8-years-old. The world fell in love with her as she was a very emotional young lady, readily expressing joy and disappointment, something that we weren't used to seeing in athletes from behind the Iron Curtain. Korbut immigrated to the US in 1991 and now lives in Scottsdale, Arizona."
_DR,"FDR.    	FDR was the only child of Sara Delano and James Roosevelt Sr. The Delano family history in America goes back to the pilgrim Phillippe de Lannoy, an immigrant of Flemish descent who arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621.

The Jonestown Massacre didn't happen until three years later, in 1978."
SE_A,"SELA.    	The actress Sela Ward turns up in crosswords a lot. Ward played Teddy Reed in the TV show ""Sisters"" in the nineties, and was in ""Once and Again"" from 1999-2002. I don't know either show, but I do know Ward from the medical drama ""House"" in which she played the hospital's lawyer and Greg House's ex-partner. That was a fun role, I thought. More recently Ward played a lead role on ""CSI: NY"" and was a very welcome and much-needed addition to the cast ..."
L_R,"LTR.    	Our paper sizes here in North America don't conform with the standards in the rest of the world. ISO standard sizes used elsewhere were chosen so that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard size of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government. Prior to this, the ""legal"" size (8.5 x 14 inches) had been the standard, since 1921."

A secondary designation of blood is the Rh factor, in which other antigens are labelled as either positive or negative. When a patient receives a blood transfusion, ideally the donor blood should be the same type as that of the recipient, as incompatible blood cells can be rejected.

The second-in-command gathered the crew on the quarterdeck, and lined them up in front of armed marines. Fearing a mass execution, the crew rushed the marines and began the famous mutiny. The event was reconstructed in an equally famous film by Sergei Eisenstein called ""The Battleship Potemkin"", a silent film released in 1925 that is considered by many to be greatest film of all time."
THA_,"THAI.    	A 'bong' is a smaller and more portable version of a 'hookah', with both being filtration devices for smoking especially tobacco and cannabis. The term 'bong' comes from the Thai word 'baung' that is used for a wooden pope cut from bamboo."
_HL,"NHL.    	The Walt Disney Company founded the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim hockey team in 1993, with the franchise's name being a nod to the 1992 Disney movie called 'The Mighty Ducks'. The name was changed to the Anaheim Ducks when Disney sold the team before the 2006-2007 season."

THA_,"THAI.    	Tom yum is a delicious spicy soup served in Thai restaurants, a favorite of mine ..."
RO_,"ROM.    	CD-ROM stands for ""compact disc read only memory"". That means you can read information from the disc (like a standard music CD for example), but you cannot write to it. You can also buy a CD-RW, which stands for ""compact disc - rewritable"", with which you can read data and also write over it multiple times using a suitable CD drive."
D_E,DEE.    	There is a letter D (dee) at either end of the word 'dead'.
ST_A,"STOA.    	A stoa was a covered walkway in Ancient Greece. A stoa usually consisted of columns lining the side of a building or buildings, with another row of columns defining the other side of the walkway. The columns supported a roof. Often stoae would surround marketplaces in large cities."
A_N,"AYN.    	""We the Living"" is the first novel by the author Ayn Rand, published in 1936."
EV_N,"EVAN.    	Evan Bayh is the son of Birch Bayh, and like his father was US Senator for the state of Indiana. Prior to serving in the Senate, Evan Bayh was State Governor."
T_M,"TAM.    	Top o' the mornin'' is a greeting usually associated with the Irish, but tams are caps usually associated with the Scottish ..."
_OM,"ROM.    	CD-ROM stands for ""compact disc read only memory"". The name indicates that you can read information from the disc (like a standard music CD for example), but you cannot write to it. You can also buy a CD-RW, which stands for ""compact disc - rewritable"", with which you can read data and also write over it multiple times using a suitable CD drive."
E_TD,ESTD.    	Established (estd.)
U_A,"UTA.    	Uta Hagen was a German-born American actress. Hagen married Jose Ferrer in 1938, but they were divorced ten years later after it was revealed that she was having a long-running affair with Paul Robeson. Her association with Robeson, a prominent civil rights activist, earned her a spot on the Hollywood Blacklist during the McCarthy Era. This forced her away from film, but towards a successful stage career in New York City."
_ED,"QED.    	QED is used at the end of a mathematical proof or a philosophical argument. The QED acronym stands for the Latin ""quod erat demonstrandum"" meaning ""that which was to be demonstrated""."
SA_,"SAT.    	Today the standardized test for admission to colleges is known as the SAT Reasoning Test, but it used to be called the Scholastic Aptitude Test and Scholastic Assessment Test, which led to the acronym SAT."
EW_K,"EWOK.    	The Ewoks are creatures who live on the moon of Endor, first appearing in ""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"". They're the cute and cuddly guys that look like teddy bears."
A_LES,"ARLES.    	A few years ago I had the privilege of living just a short car ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although it has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design. It has a spectacular Roman amphitheater, arch, circus as well as old walls that surround the center of the city. In more modern times, it was a place that Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Cafe Terrace at Night"" and ""Bedroom in Arles""."
Y_L,"YSL.    	Yves Saint-Laurent was a French fashion designer, actually born in Algeria. Saint-Laurent started off working as an assistant to Christian Dior at the age of 17. Dior died just four years later, and as a very young man Saint-Laurent was named head of the House of Dior. However, in 1950 Saint-Laurent was conscripted into the French Army and ended up in a military hospital after suffering a mental breakdown from the hazing inflicted on him by his fellow soldiers. His treatment included electroshock therapy and administration of sedatives and psychoactive drugs. He was released from prison, managed to pull his life back together and started his own fashion house. A remarkable story ..."
_LAR,"ALAR.    	""Alar"" means ""wing-shaped"", and comes from the Latin word ""alaris"" meaning ""wing""."
MO_T,"MOOT.    	I reckon this clue is backwards. To moot, is to bring up as a subject for discussion or debate. So, something that is moot is open to debate. Something that is no longer moot, is no longer worth debating."
S_AM,"SPAM.    	Apparently the term ""spam"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word Spam, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""spam"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."
LEG_,"LEGO.    	Lego is manufactured by Lego Group, a privately held company headquartered in Billund, Denmark. The company was founded by a carpenter called Ole Kirk Christiansen who had been making wooden toys in his workshop since 1932. The Lego company was created in 1934, and the now-famous plastic interlocking blocks were introduced in 1949 and sold as ""Automatic Binding Bricks"". ""Lego"" is easier to remember, I think! The company name comes from the Danish term ""leg godt"" meaning ""play well""."
S_ENO,"STENO.    	Stenography is the process of writing in shorthand. The term comes from the Greek ""steno"" (narrow) and ""graphe"" (writing)."
LE_,"LEA.    	The word ""bucolic"", meaning rustic or rural, comes to us from the Greek word for a ""cowherd"", ""boukolos""."
STE_O,"STENO.    	Stenography is the process of writing in shorthand. The term comes from the Greek ""steno"" (narrow) and ""graphe"" (writing)."
OL_A,"OLGA.    	Olga, Masha and Irina were the 'Three Sisters' in the play by Anton Chekhov. The three title characters were inspired by the three Brontë sisters, the English authors."
OGE_,"OGEE.    	An ogee is a type of S-curve. Specifically it is a figure consisting of two arcs that curve in opposite directions (like an S) but both ends of the curve end up parallel to each other (which is not necessarily true for an S). An ogee arch is composed of two ogees, with one being the mirror of the other and meeting at the arch's apex."
YE_S,"YENS.    	The word ""yen"", meaning ""urge"", has been around in English since the very early 1900s. It comes from the earlier word ""yin"" imported from Chinese, which was used in English to describe an intense craving for opium!"
ENIA_,"ENIAC.    	The acronym ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (although many folks insist that the C was for ""Computer""). ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables, but it ended up being used early on to make calculations necessary for the development of the hydrogen bomb. Given its uses, it's not surprising to hear that development of ENIAC was funded by the US Army during WWII."
MI_A,"MIRA.    	Mira Sorvino is an American actress, winner of an Oscar for her supporting role in the 1995 Woody Allen movie ""Mighty Aphrodite"". She also played a title role opposite Lisa Kudrow in the very forgettable film ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion""."
_TS,"STS.    	Saint Valentine&#8217;s Day was chosen by Pope Gelasius I in 496 AD to honor various martyrs with the name Valentine. However, the saints' day was dropped by the Roman Catholic church in 1969, by Pope Paul VI. Try telling that to Hallmark though &#8230;"
T_A,"TVA.    	The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has to be one of America's great success stories when it comes to economic development. Created in 1933, the TVA spearheaded economic development in the Tennessee Valley at the height of the Great Depression. Central to the success was the federally-funded construction of flood-control and electricity-generation facilities."
VA_,"VAL.    	Val-d'Or is a city in Quebec. 'Val-d'Or' is French for 'Valley of Gold', a reference to the gold deposits discovered in the area in 1923."
SSN_,"SSNS.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, a SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax forms who did not exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in the following year's tax returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."
RN_,RNS.    	Registered Nurses work with EMTs.
_AA,"FAA.    	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was set up in 1958 (as the Federal Aviation Agency). The agency was established at that particular time largely in response to an increasing number of midair collisions. The worst of these disasters had taken place two years earlier over the Grand Canyon, a crash between two commercial passenger airplanes that resulted in 128 fatalities."
A_KS,"ARKS.    	The term 'ark', when used with reference to Noah, is a translation of the Hebrew word 'tebah'. The word 'tebah' is also used in the Bible for the basket in which Moses was placed by his mother when she floated him down the Nile. It seems that the word 'tebah' doesn't mean 'boat' and nor does it mean 'basket'. Rather, a more appropriate translation is 'life-preserver' or 'life-saver'. So, Noah's ark was Noah's life-preserver during the flood."
D_E,DEE.    	The end of the word 'end' is the letter D (dee).
AX_L,AXEL.    	An Axel is a forward take-off jump in figure skating. It was first performed by Norwegian Axel Paulsen at the 1882 World Figure Skating championships.
US_,"USB.    	Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard dealing with how computers and electronic devices connect and communicate, and deal with electrical power through those connections."

Created in 1933, the TVA spearheaded economic development in the Tennessee Valley at the height of the Great Depression. Central to the success was the federally-funded construction of flood-control and electricity-generation facilities."
S_ED,"SLED.    	The comic strip ""Calvin and Hobbes"" is still widely syndicated, but hasn't been written since 1995. The cartoonist Bill Watterson named the character Calvin after John Calvin, the 16th century theologian. Hobbes was named for Thomas Hobbes a 17th century English political philosopher."
EF_,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."
DI_,"DIE.    	The numbers on dice are arranged so that the opposite faces add up to seven. Given this arrangement, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 all meet at a common vertex. Now, there are two ways of arranging the 1, 2 and 3 around the common vertex, a so called right-handed die (clockwise 1-2-3) or a left-handed die (counterclockwise 1-2-3). Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."
_SP,"TSP.    	Apparently a teaspoon (tsp.) can be divided into 76 drops, or 100 metric drops."
S_ED,SLED.    	'Flexible flyer' is now a generic term for a steel runner sled that can be steered with the feet. The original Flexible Flyer was patented in 1889.
P_TA,"PITA.    	Tabouleh is one my my favorite dishes. It is usually made from bulgur, tomato, cucumber, parsley, mint, onion, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice. Just writing that list of ingredients gets my mouth watering ..."
PI_A,"PITA.    	Pita is a lovely bread in Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. Pita is usually round, and has a ""pocket"" in the center. The pocket is created by steam that puffs up the dough during cooking leaving a void when the bread cools. The pockets were a big hit in the seventies when someone came up with the idea of using them for fillings hence creating pita sandwiches or ""pita pockets""."
E_HER,"ETHER.    	Ethers are a whole class of organic compounds, but in the vernacular 'ether' is specifically diethyl ether. Diethyl ether was once very popular as a general anesthetic."
ION_,"IONA.    	Iona College is a Roman Catholic college run by the Christian Brothers, in New Rochelle, New York."
_RANI,IRANI.    	The Islamic sects of Sunni and Shia Muslims differ in the belief of who should have taken over leadership of the Muslim faithful after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Followers of the Sunni tradition agree with the decision that the Prophet Muhammad's confidante Abu Bakr was the right choice to become the first Caliph of the Islamic nation. Followers of the Shia tradition believe that leadership should have stayed within the Prophet Muhammad's own family.
PO_,"POI.    	The corm of some taro plants is used to make poi, the traditional Hawaiian dish (that I think tastes horrible). When a taro plant is grown as an ornamental, it is often called Elephant Ears due to the shape of its large leaves."
_RNST,"ERNST.    	Ernst Stavro Blofeld is a villain in the James Bond universe. Blofeld has been played on the big screen several times by different actors. My favorite is Donald Pleasance in 1967's 'You Only Live Twice'. In the original Ian Fleming novels, Blofeld was born on 28 May 1908, which happens to be Fleming's own birthday."
_LO,"FLO.    	Flo was a waitress in the sitcom ""Alice"" that ran in the seventies and eighties. The character got her own show called ""Flo"" but it only ran a couple of years."
_TS,STS.    	Street (st.)
ODE_SA,"ODESSA.    	The city of Odessa, Texas has as its symbol the jack rabbit. This is because from the thirties through the seventies the city hosted a rodeo for roping rabbits. The Humane Society applied pressure and the city did away with the tradition in 1977."
D_HL,"DAHL.    	Roald Dahl's name is Norwegian, as his parents were from Norway. Dahl himself was Welsh, and became one of the most successful authors of the twentieth century. Some of his famous titles are ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""."
_NS,RNS.    	Registered Nurses are qualified to adjust a patient's Intra-Venous drip.
LED_,"LEDA.    	In Greek mythology, Leda was the beautiful Queen of Sparta who was seduced by Zeus when he took the form of a swan. Leda produced two eggs from the union. One egg hatched into the beautiful Helen, later to be known as Helen of Troy and over whom the Trojan War was fought. The other egg hatched into the twins Castor and Pollux. Castor and Pollux had different fathers according to the myth. Pollux was the son of Zeus and was immortal, while Castor was the son of Leda's earthly husband, and so he was a mortal. William Butler Yeats wrote a famous sonnet called 'Leda and the Swan' in 1924."
ORSO_,"ORSON.    	Orson Bean is an actor, perhaps best known for his appearances on television game shows in the sixties, seventies and eighties. His most famous game show role was that of a panelist on ""To Tell the Truth"". Interestingly, Bean (real name Dallas Burrows) is a first cousin, twice removed, of President Calvin Coolidge."
ASIA_,"ASIAN.    	Some species of myna (also ""mynah"") bird are known for their ability to imitate sounds."
OM_O,"OMOO.    	Herman Melville mined his own experiences when writing his novels. Melville sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1841 on a whaler heading into the Pacific Ocean (a source for ""Moby Dick""). Melville ended up deserting his ship 18 months later and lived with natives on a South Pacific Island for three weeks (a source for ""Typee""). He picked up another whaler and headed for Hawaii, where he joined the crew of a US navy frigate that was bound for Boston (a source for ""Omoo"")."
A_F,"ATF.    	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is today part of the department of Justice. However it has its roots in the Department of Treasury dating back to 1886 when it was known as the Bureau of Prohibition. ""Explosives"" was added to the department's name when the bureau was moved under the control of the Department of Justice as part of the government reorganization called out in the Homeland Security Act of 2002."
_EM,"DEM.    	On political maps, red states are Republican, and blue states Democrat. The designations of red and blue states is a very recent concept, introduced in the 2000 presidential election by TV journalist, the late Tim Russert. In retrospect, the choice of colors is surprising, as in other democracies around the world, red is usually used to describe left-leaning, socialist parties (the reds under the bed!), and blue is used for conservative, right-wing parties. "
S_ED,"SLED.    	Toboggan came into English from the French Canadian ""tabagane"", the name for the long sled with a flat bottom. The French Canadian word is probably from the Algonquian word for a sled, ""tobakun"","
AR_S,"ARKS.    	According to the Bible's Book of Exodus, the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed were placed in a chest called the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark was built according to instructions given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. The tablets that were preserved were actually copies, as Moses smashed the originals given to him by God. Moses did so in a fit of anger when when he saw his people worshiping the Golden Calf."
FD_,"FDR.    	During the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), intended to be a temporary government corporation that provided insurance on deposits made by customers of qualified financial institutions. The first accounts to be covered, in 1934, had an insurance limit of $2,500. Since the financial crisis of 2008, that limit is $250,000."
M_ED,"MR ED.    	""Mister Ed"" first aired in 1961 and ran for almost five years. It was a very successful show (and even made it to Ireland!). Mister Ed, the talking horse, was a palomino that had the real name of Bamboo Harvester. Mister Ed's ""voice"" was that of actor Allan ""Rocky"" Lane, a star of a lot of B-movie westerns from the forties and fifties. In the show, Mister Ed would only talk to the lead (human) character Wilbur, played by Alan Young, leading to some hilarious situations. Mister Ed had a stunt double and stand-in for the show, another horse called Pumpkin. Pumpkin later played the horse that made frequent appearances on the show ""Green Acres""."
O_AV,"OLAV.    	Of the many kings of Norway named Olaf/Olav (and there have been five), Olaf II is perhaps the most celebrated as he was canonized and made patron saint of the country. Olaf II was king from 1015 to 1028 and was known as ""Olaf the Big"" (or Olaf the Fat) during his reign. Today he is more commonly referred to as ""Olaf the Holy"". After Olaf died he was given the title of Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae, which is Latin for 'Norway's Eternal King'."

Mister Ed had a stunt double and stand-in for the show, another horse called Pumpkin. Pumpkin later made frequent appearances on the show ""Green Acres""."
REE_,"REED.    	The crumhorn is a woodwind instrument that was very popular during the Renaissance. The name comes from the German ""Krumhorn"" meaning ""bent horn"", which adequately describes the instrument's shape, somewhat like the letter ""J"". As it is a woodwind, the sound is produced by blowing air past a reed, in fact a double-reed in the case of a crumhorn."
AP_A,"APIA.    	Apia is the capital city, and in fact the only city, of the Pacific island-nation of Samoa. The harbor of Apia is famous for a very foolish incident in 1889 involving seven naval vessels from Germany, the US and Britain. A typhoon was approaching so the safest thing to do was to head for open water away from land, but no nation would move its ships for fear of losing face in front of the others. Six of the ships were lost in the typhoon as a result and 200 American and German sailors perished. The British cruiser HMS Calliope barely managed to escape from the harbor and rode out the storm safely."

NAT_,NATE.    	FiveThirtyEight is a website that publishes compiled polling date during election cycles. The site takes its name from from the total number of electors in the US electoral college.

O_ESSA,"ODESSA.    	The city of Odessa, Texas has as its symbol the jack rabbit. This is because from the thirties through the seventies the city hosted a rodeo for roping rabbits. The Humane Society applied pressure and the city did away with the tradition in 1977."
_YSE,NYSE.    	The roots of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) go back to 1792 when a group of 24 stock brokers set up the New York Stock & Exchange Board. They did so in an agreement signed under a buttonwood tree outside 68 Wall Street. That document became known as the Buttonwood Agreement.
USD_,"USDA.    	The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) actually dates back to 1862 when it was established by then-president Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln referred to the USDA as the ""people's department"" as our economy had such a vast agrarian base back then."
L_OS,"LAOS.

Practically the entire trail was hidden from the air using natural and man-made camouflage that was constantly maintained."
L_E,"LYE.    	What we call 'lye' is usually sodium hydroxide, although historically the term was used for potassium hydroxide. Lye has many uses, including to cure several foodstuffs. Lye can make olives less bitter, for example. The chemical is also found in canned mandarin oranges, pretzels and Japanese ramen noodles.

P_LE,"PELE.    	Pelé is the nickname of Edson de Nascimento, a soccer player who has used the name Pelé for most of his life. Pelé is now retired, and for my money was the world's greatest ever player of the game. He is the only person to have been part of three World Cup winning squads, and is a national treasure in his native Brazil."
CP_,"CPR.    	Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation used to involve the simultaneous compression of the chest to pump blood using the heart, and artificial respiration by blowing air into the lungs. Nowadays emergency services are placing more emphasis on the heart compressions, and less on the artificial respiration (I just discovered)."
STO_,"STOA.    	A stoa was a covered walkway in Ancient Greece.

EC_N,"ECON.    	Karl Marx was a German philosopher and revolutionary who helped develop the principles of modern communism and socialism. Marx argued that feudal society created internal strife due to class inequalities which led to its destruction and replacement by capitalism. He further argued that the inequalities created in a capitalist society create tensions that will also lead to its self-destruction. His thesis was that the inevitable replacement of capitalism was a classless (and stateless) society, which he called pure communism."

_RU,"TRU.    	""Tru"" was written by Jay Presson Allen and is a play about Truman Capote that premiered in 1989. There is a classic anachronism in the piece. It is set in Capote's New York City apartment at Christmas 1975. At one point the Capote character talks about suicide, saying that he has enough pills to stage his own Jonestown Massacre. The Jonestown Massacre didn't happen until three years later, in 1978."

Although the small island of Iona lies just off the west coast of Scotland, it was the site of a monastery built in the Middle Ages by the Irish monk, Colm Cille (also known as Columba). Colm Cille and his followers were sent into exile from the Irish mainland, and settled in Iona, which at that time was part of one of the Irish kingdoms. This monastery in Iona expanded it's influence over the decades, founding other institutions all over Ireland and Great Britain. It is believed that the famous Book of Kells, now housed in Trinity College, Dublin, may have been written or at least started, at the monastery on Iona."

Shortly after ATF agents tried to execute a search warrant, shots were fired and at the end of the fight six people inside the Branch Davidian compound were dead, as were four agents.

ADL_B,"AD LIB.    	""Ad libitum"" is a Latin phrase meaning ""at one's pleasure"". In common usage the phrase is usually shortened to ""ad lib"".

S_HO,"SOHO.    	The Manhattan neighborhood known today as SoHo was very fashionable in the early 1900s, but as the well-heeled started to move uptown the area became very run down and poorly maintained. Noted for the number of fires that erupted in derelict buildings, SoHo earned the nickname ""Hell's Hundred Acres"". The area was then zoned for manufacturing and became home to many sweatshops. In the mid-1900s artists started to move into open loft spaces and renovating old buildings as the lofts were ideal locations in which an artist could both live and work. In 1968, artists and others organized themselves so that they could legalize their residential use of an area zoned for manufacturing. The group they formed took its name from the name given to the area by the city's Planning Commission i.e ""South of Houston"". This was shortened from So-uth of Ho-uston to SoHo as in the SoHo Artists Association, and the name stuck."

E_NINO,"EL NINO.    	When the surface temperature of much of the Pacific Ocean rises more that half a degree centigrade, then there is said to be an El Niño episode. That small temperature change in the Pacific has been associated with climatic changes that can stretch right across the globe.

The phenomenon was given this particular Spanish name because the warming is usually noticed near South America and around Christmas-time."
A_IA,"APIA.    	Apia is the capital city, and in fact the only city, of the Pacific island-nation of Samoa. The harbor of Apia is famous for a very foolish incident in 1889 involving seven naval vessels from Germany, the US and Britain. A typhoon was approaching so the safest thing to do was to head for open water away from land, but no nation would move its ships for fear of losing face in front of the others. Six of the ships were lost in the typhoon as a result and 200 American and German sailors perished. The British cruiser HMS Calliope barely managed to escape from the harbor and rode out the storm safely.

M_ED,"MR ED.    	The sitcom 'Mister Ed' first aired in 1961 and ran for almost five years. It was a very successful show (and even made it to Ireland!). Mister Ed, the talking horse, was a palomino that had the real name of Bamboo Harvester. Mister Ed's 'voice' was that of actor Allan 'Rocky' Lane, a star of a lot of B-movie westerns from the forties and fifties. In the show, Mister Ed would only talk to the lead (human) character Wilbur, played by Alan Young, leading to some hilarious situations. Mister Ed had a stunt double and stand-in for the show, another horse called Pumpkin. Pumpkin later made frequent appearances on the show 'Green Acres'."
_OI,"POI.    	I am a big fan of starch, and being an Irishman I love potatoes however they are prepared. That said, I think that poi tastes horrible!

Apu's undergraduate degree is from Caltech (the Calcutta Technical Institute), where he graduated top of his class of seven million students ..."
A_LES,"ARLES.    	Quite a few years ago now, I had the privilege of living just a short car-ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although Arles has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design. Arles has a spectacular Roman amphitheater, arch, circus as well as old walls that surround the center of the city. In more modern times, it was a place Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Cafe Terrace at Night"", as well as ""Bedroom in Arles""."
SPA_,"SPAM.    	Apparently the term ""spam"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word Spam, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""spam"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."

SLE_T,"SLEET.    	Apparently ""sleet"" is a term used to describe two weather conditions. One is a shower of ice pellets, smaller than hail, and the second is a mixture of rain and snow, with the snow melting as it falls. It's the second definition that I have always used ..."

There is also the Tate Liverpool in the north of England located in an old warehouse, and the Tate St. Ives in the west country located in an old gas works. My favorite of the Tate galleries is the Tate Modern which lies on the banks of the Thames in London. It's a beautiful building, a converted power station, that you have to see to believe."
L_LA,"LOLA.    	""Lola"" is a fabulous song, written by Ray Davies and released by the Kinks back in 1970.

The koala is an arboreal marsupial and a herbivore, native to the east and south coasts of Australia. Koalas aren't primates, and are one of the few mammals other than primates who have fingerprints. In fact, it can be very difficult to tell human fingerprints from koala fingerprints, even under an electron microscope. Male koalas are called 'bucks', females are 'does', and young koalas are 'joeys'. I'm a little jealous of the koala, as it sleeps up to 20 hours a day ..."

RA_I,"RAVI.    	The sitar has been around since the Middle Ages. The sitar is a stringed instrument that is played by plucking, and is used most often in Hindustani classical music.

ELNI_O,"EL NINO.    	When the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean rises or falls more that half a degree centigrade, then there is said to be an El Niño episode. That small temperature change in the Pacific has been associated with climatic changes that can stretch right across the globe. El Niño is Spanish for ""the boy"" and is a reference to the Christ child. The phenomenon was given this particular Spanish name because the warming is usually noticed near South America and around Christmas-time."
TOG_,"TOGA.    	In Ancient Rome the classical attire known as a toga (plural 'togae') was usually worn over a tunic. The tunic was made from linen, and the toga itself was a piece of cloth about twenty feet long made from wool. The toga could only be worn by men, and only if those men were Roman citizens. The female equivalent of the toga was called a 'stola'."
_EAH,LEAH.    	Leah was the older sister of Rachel and the first wife of Jacob. Leah was also mother of six of the twelve tribes of Israel as she was mother of six of Jacob's sons (she also had one daughter).
AS_AN,ASIAN.    	The eastern side of the Ural Mountains in Russia is generally regarded as the natural divide between the continents of Europe and Asia.
NYS_,"NYSE.    	The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can give some quite descriptive ticker symbols to companies, for example:"
T_M,"TAM.    	A tam o'shanter is a man's cap traditionally worn by Scotsmen. ""Tams"" were originally all blue (and called ""blue bonnets"") but as more dyes became readily available they became more colorful. The name of the cap comes from the title character of the Robert Burns poem ""Tam O'Shanter""."
_THER,"ETHER.    	Ethers are a whole class of organic compounds, but in the vernacular 'ether' is specifically diethyl ether. Diethyl ether was once very popular as a general anesthetic."
T_M,"TAM.    	A tam o'shanter is a man's cap traditionally worn by Scotsmen. ""Tams"" were originally all blue (and called ""blue bonnets""), but as more dyes became readily available they became more colorful. The name of the cap comes from the title character of Robert Burns' poem ""Tam O'Shanter""."
_OLA,"LOLA.    	""Lola"" is a fabulous song, written by Ray Davies and released by the Kinks back in 1970. Inspired by a real life incident, the lyrics tell of young man who met a young ""lady"" in a club, danced with her and then discovered ""she"" was actually a transvestite. The storyline isn't very traditional, but the music is superb."

OLD_,"OLDS.    	Oldsmobile was an automobile brand founded by Ransom E. Olds (REO) in 1897, and then phased out by General Motors in 2004."
_DLIB,"AD LIB.    	""Ad libitum"" is a Latin phrase meaning ""at one's pleasure"". In common usage the phrase is usually shortened to ""ad lib"". On the stage the concept of an ""ad lib"" is very familiar. For example, an actor who substitutes his own words for forgotten lines uses an ad lib. Or, a director may instruct an actor to use his or her own words at a particular point in a performance to promote a feeling of spontaneity."
_KE,"EKE.    	I believe that technically speaking one can't actually ""eke out"" an existence, as to ""eke out"" means to ""make something go further or last longer"". So, you can eke out your income by cutting back on expenses, but you can't eke out your existence, or any existence."
RO_N,"ROAN.    	A roan horse has an even mixture of white and colored hairs on the body with the head, lower legs, mane and tail having a more solid color."
_GEE,OGEE.    	An ogee is like an s-curve. Specifically it is a figure consisting of two arcs that curve in opposite directions (like an S) but both ends of the curve end up parallel to each other (which is not necessarily true for an S).
I_EM,"ITEM.    	An unmarried couple known to be involved with each other might appear in the gossip columns. This appearance as ""an item"" in the papers, led to the use of ""item"" to refer to such a couple, but only since the very early seventies."
NY_E,NYSE.    	The roots of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) go back to 1792 when a group of 24 stock brokers set up the New York Stock & Exchange Board. They did so in an agreement signed under a buttonwood tree outside 68 Wall Street. That document became known as the Buttonwood Agreement.
LE_H,"LEAH.    	Leah, the older sister of Rachel, is the first wife of Jacob and mother of six of the twelve tribes of Israel."

His current instructions are for the royal family to agree on a successor after his death. Qaboos has also specified that should the royal not be able to agree on a successor, then the country's Defense Council will make the decision, choosing between two names that the Sultan placed in a sealed envelope to be opened after his passing."
_YE,"EYE.    	If you look at the back of a one-dollar bill there is an eye sitting above a pyramid.

The Eye of Providence is a common Christian emblem from the Middle Ages and Renaissance."
_DR,FDR.    	President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a total of thirty evening radio addresses that were termed 'fireside chats'. President Roosevelt had used similar addresses to further his political agenda while he was Governor of New York. In New York he faced opposition from a Republican legislature so Roosevelt appealed directly to voters to apply pressure for him.
OSAK_,"OSAKA.    	Osaka used to be called Naniwa, with the name changing to Osaka some time before 1500. The name Osaka can be translated either as ""large hill"" or ""large slope""."

That small temperature change in the Pacific has been associated with climatic changes that can stretch right across the globe. El Niño is Spanish for ""the boy"" and is a reference to the Christ child. The phenomenon was given this Spanish name because the warming is usually noticed near South America and around Christmas-time."
_FT,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."
S_AM,"SPAM.    	Apparently the term ""spam"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word Spam, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""spam"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."
AMA_I,"AMATI.    	The first of the Amati family to make violins was Andrea Amati, who lived in the 14th century. He was succeeded by his sons, Antonio and Girolamo. In turn, they were succeeded by Girolamo's son, Nicolo. Nicolo had a few students who achieved fame making musical instruments as well. One was his own son, Girolamo, and another was the famed Antonio Stradivari."
ENIA_,"ENIAC.    	The acronym ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (although many folks insist that the C was for ""Computer""). ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables, but it ended up being used early on to make calculations necessary for the development of the hydrogen bomb. Given its uses, it's not surprising to hear that development of ENIAC was funded by the US Army during WWII."
_SNS,SSNS.    	Social security number (SSN)
_ENS,"YENS.    	The word ""yen"", meaning ""urge"", has been around in English since the very early 1900s. It comes from the earlier word ""yin"" imported from Chinese, which was used in English to describe an intense craving for opium!"

The screenplay for the film was written by Graham Greene."
A_LES,"ARLES.    	Quite a few years ago now, I had the privilege of living just a short car-ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although Arles has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design. Arles has a spectacular Roman amphitheater, arch, circus as well as old walls that surround the center of the city. In more modern times, it was a place Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Cafe Terrace at Night"", as well as ""Bedroom in Arles""."

AP_A,"APIA.    	Apia is the capital city, and in fact the only city, of the Pacific island-nation of Samoa. The harbor of Apia is famous for a very foolish incident in 1889 involving seven naval vessels from Germany, the US and Britain. A typhoon was approaching so the safest thing to do was to head for open water away from land, but no nation would move its ships for fear of losing face in front of the others. Six of the ships were lost in the typhoon as a result and 200 American and German sailors perished. The British cruiser HMS Calliope barely managed to escape from the harbor and rode out the storm safely."

Korbut immigrated to the US in 1991 and now lives in Scottsdale, Arizona."

Castor and Pollux had different fathers according to the myth. Pollux was the son of Zeus and was immortal, while Castor was the son of Leda's earthly husband, and so he was a mortal.
