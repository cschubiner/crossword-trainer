The story is that the native was actually saying 'I don't understand you', but as cute as that tale is, it's just an urban myth."
SA_,"SAL.    	Sal Mineo's most famous role was that of John ""Plate"" Crawford, the kid who was in awe of the James Dean character in ""Rebel Without a Cause"". Sadly, Sal Mineo was murdered in in 1976, when he was just 37 years old. He was attacked in the alley behind his Los Angeles apartment and stabbed through the heart. An arrest was made, and it was discovered that the murderer apparently had no idea who his victim was and was just intent on robbery."

_PA,"SPA.    	Jacuzzi is one of those brand names that has become so much associated with the product that it is often assumed to be a generic term. The Jacuzzi company was founded in 1915 by the seven(!) Jacuzzi brothers in Berkeley California. The brothers, who were Italian immigrants, pronounced their name ""ja-coot-si"", as one might suspect when one realizes the name is of Italian origin. The company started off by making aircraft propellers and then small aircraft, but suspended aircraft production in 1925 when one the brothers was killed in one of their planes. The family then started making hydraulic pumps, and in 1948 developed a submersible bathtub pump so that a son of one of the brothers could enjoy hydrotherapy for his rheumatoid arthritis. The ""hydrotherapy product"" took off in the fifties with some astute marketing towards ""worn-out housewives"" and the use of celebrity spokesman Jack Benny."

_OO,"LOO.    	When I was growing up in Ireland, a ""bathroom"" was a room that had a bath and no toilet. The separate room with the commode was called ""the toilet"" or sometimes the W.C. (the water closet). Apparently the term closet was used because in the 1800s when homeowners started installing toilets indoors they often displaced clothes and linens in a ""closet"", as a closet was the right size to take the commode. It has been suggested that the British term ""loo"" comes from Waterloo (water-closet ... water-loo), but no one seems to know for sure. Another suggestion is that the term comes from the card game of ""lanterloo"" in which the pot was called the loo!"

_STS,"SSTS.    	The most famous Supersonic Transport (SST) was the Concorde, a plane that's no longer flying. Concorde had that famous ""droop nose"". The nose was moved to the horizontal position during flight to create the optimum aerodynamic shape thereby reducing drag. It was lowered during taxi, takeoff and landing, so that the pilot had better visibility. The need for the droop nose was driven largely by the delta-shaped wings. The delta wing necessitates a higher angle of attack at takeoff and landing than conventional wing designs, so the pilot needed the nose lowered so that he or she could see the ground."

(the water closet). Apparently the term closet was used because in the 1800s when homeowners started installing toilets indoors they often displaced clothes in a ""closet"", as a closet was the right size to take the commode. It has been suggested that the British term ""loo"" comes from Waterloo (water-closet ... water-loo), but no one seems to know for sure."

Back in the 1800s, the Las Vegas Valley was given its name from the extensive meadows (""las vegas"" is Spanish for ""the meadows"") present in the area courtesy of the artesian wells drilled by local farmers. Las Vegas was incorporated as a city in 1905, in the days when it was a stopping-off point for pioneers travelling west. It eventually became a railroad town, although with the coming of the railroad growth halted as travelers began to bypass Las Vegas. The city's tourism industry took off in 1935 with the completion of the nearby Hoover Dam, which is still a popular attraction. Then gambling was legalized, and things really started to move. Vegas was picked, largely by celebrated figures in ""the mob"", as a convenient location across the California/Nevada state line that could service the vast population of Los Angeles. As a result, Las Vegas is the most populous US city founded in the 20th century (Chicago is the most populous city founded in the 19th century, just in case you were wondering)."

OBO_,"OBOE.    	The oboe is perhaps my favorite of the reed instruments. The name ""oboe"" comes from the French ""hautbois"" which means ""high wood"". When you hear an orchestra tuning before a performance, you'll note (pun intended!) the oboe starts off the process by playing an ""A"". The rest of the musicians in turn tune to that oboe's ""A"". Oh, and if you want to read a fun book (almost an ""exposé"") about life playing the oboe, you might try ""Mozart in the Jungle"" by oboist Blair Tindall. I heard recently that HBO are working towards a pilot based on the book. I can't wait to see it!"
OPER_,"OPERA.    	The Latin for work is 'opus', with the plural being 'opera'."

This latter series started with Able, Baker, Charlie, with O and P represented by Oboe and Peter. The NATO equivalents for O and P are Oscar and Papa."
D_A,"DNA.    	I've always been fascinated by the fact that the DNA of living things is so very similar across different species. Human DNA is almost exactly the same for every individual (to the degree of 99.9%). However, those small differences are sufficient to distinguish one individual from another, and to determine whether or not individuals are close family relations."

RE_,"REA.    	""Mens rea"" is Latin for ""guilty mind"" and is a central concept in criminal law. The concept is expanded to ""actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea"" meaning ""the act does not make a person guilty unless the mind be also guilty"". In other words, a someone should not be deemed guilty of an act, unless he or she had a ""guilty mind"", intended to do wrong."
ALE_,"ALEC.    	The full name of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel is ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles' A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented"". When it was originally published, ""Tess ..."" received very mixed reviews, largely because it addressed some difficult sexual themes including rape, and sexual double standards (attitudes towards men vs women). I suppose the most celebrated screen adaptation is Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" released in 1979. Polanski apparently made ""Tess"" because his wife, Sharon Tate, gave him Hardy's novel as her last act before she was murdered by the Manson family. There is a dedication at the beginning of the movie that just says ""To Sharon""."

The term 'pupil' came into English via French from the latin 'pupilla', which is the diminutive form of 'pupa' meaning 'girl, doll'.

Her Donegal family (in the northwest of Ireland) formed a band called Clannad, which included Enya. In 1980 Enya left Clannad launched a very successful solo career. Personally, I don't like her music, as it all sounds the same to me, but she sure does turn up in crosswords a lot!"

Apparently the term closet was used because in the 1800s when homeowners started installing toilets indoors they often displaced clothes in a ""closet"", as a closet was the right size to take the commode. It has been suggested that the British term ""loo"" comes from Waterloo (water-closet ... water-loo), but no one seems to know for sure."
