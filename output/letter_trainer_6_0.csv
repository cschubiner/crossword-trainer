When it was originally published, ""Tess ..."" received very mixed reviews, largely because it addresses some difficult sexual themes including rape, and sexual double standards (society's attitude towards men vs women). I suppose the most celebrated screen adaptation is Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" released in 1979. Polanski apparently made ""Tess"" because his wife, Sharon Tate, gave him Hardy's novel as her last act before she was murdered by the Manson family. There is a dedication at the beginning of the movie that simply reads ""To Sharon""."

_VE,"EVE.    	I must confess that I have a problem with movies starring Bette Davis. I think I must have seen her play one of her more sinister roles when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares or something. So, I have never seen the 1950 classic ""All About Eve"", given that Bette Davis gets top billing. But, the title role of Eve Harrington was played by Anne Baxter, and Ms Baxter's movies I do enjoy.

The longest entry for one word in the second edition of the OED is the verb ""set"". When the third edition was published in 2007, the longest entry for a single word became the verb ""put"". Perhaps not surprisingly, the most-quoted author in the OED is William Shakespeare, with his most quoted work being 'Hamlet'. The most-quoted female author is George Eliot (aka Mary Ann Evans). "
_SO,"TSO.    	General Tso's chicken is an American creation, often found on the menu of a Chinese restaurant. The name General Tso may be a reference to General Zuo Zongtang of the Qing Dynasty, but there is no clear link."
AMO_,"AMOS.    	""Amos 'n' Andy"" was originally a radio sitcom that was on the air from the twenties right up to the fifties. It was about Amos Jones and Andy Brown, two farm workers from outside Atlanta who head to Chicago to make good for themselves. They eventually start up the Fresh Air Taxi Company. The show was somewhat groundbreaking for the time, as it depicted African Americans for the first time in positions of influence as business owners. There was a TV adaptation that aired from 1951 to 1953 and ran in syndication right up to 1966. I have never seen/heard the show, but it sounds like it is a classic ..."

NE_P,"NEAP.    	Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the oceans. At neap tide, the smaller gravitational effect of the sun cancels out some of the moon's effect. At spring tide, the sun and the moon's gravitational forces act in concert causing more extreme movement of the oceans."
R_I,"RPI.    	The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is a private school in Troy, New York. The university is named after its founder Stephen Van Rensselaer who set up the school in 1824. The goal of RPI has always been the ""application of science to the common purposes of life"", an objective set by the founder. Given that, the name for the school's sports teams is quite apt: the Engineers."
_ER,"AER.    	Aer Lingus, my favorite airline! Well, the service isn't great, to be honest, but when I get on board an Aer Lingus plane I feel like I am back in Ireland. Aer Lingus is the national airline of Ireland, with Aer Lingus being a phonetic spelling of the Irish ""aer-loingeas"" meaning ""air fleet"". These days Aer Lingus can only lay claim to the title of Ireland's oldest airline as it's no longer the biggest. That honor goes to the controversial Ryan Air."

OR_ON,"ORION.    	The very recognizable constellation of Orion is of course named after the Greek God Orion, the Hunter. If you take a look at the star in Orion's ""right shoulder"", the second brightest star in the constellation, you might notice that it is quite red in color. This is the famous star called Betelgeuse, a red supergiant, a huge star that is on its way out. It is expected to explode into a supernova within the next thousand years or so. You don't want to miss that ..."
IA_O,"IAGO.    	Iago is the schemer in Shakespeare's ""Othello"". Iago is a soldier who fought alongside Othello and feels hard done by, missing out on promotion. He hatches a plot designed to discredit his rival Cassio by insinuating that Cassio is having an affair with Desdemona, Othello's wife. By the end of the play it's Iago himself who is discredited and Othello (before committing suicide) apologizes to Cassio for having believed Iago's lies. Heavy stuff ..."

I say just stay out of the sun ..."
UF_,"UFO.    	In 1952, the USAF revived its studies of reported Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) sightings in a program called Project Blue Book. There were two prior USAF studies of the UFO phenomenon, namely Project Sign and Project Grudge.

_LR,"SLR.    	SLR stands for ""single lens reflex"". Usually cameras with changeable lenses are the SLR type. The main feature of an SLR is that a mirror reflects the image seen through the lens out through the viewfinder, so that the photographer sees exactly what the lens sees. The mirror moves out of the way as the picture is taken, and the image that comes through the lens falls onto unexposed film, or nowadays onto a digital sensor."
ESSE_,"ESSEN.    	I knew a man back in Ireland, a German national from the city of Essen. He had very sad tales to tell from the days of WWII. As a young boy he lost his (socialist) parents during the Nazi purges early in the war. In 1943, he was living with his grandmother and still attending school when he was drafted into the army along with the rest of his class (at 14 years old, he told me). His platoon leader was his old school teacher who made a point of tutoring the boys in place of military drilling. One day, he was on guard duty with his class/platoon at the dam above the city, and along come the Dam Busters, with their bouncing bombs. The raid was successful (from the perspective of the Allies), but he described terrible famine faced by the people below the dam due to flooding of the farmland that surrounded the factories."

AES_P,"AESOP.    	Aesop lived in Ancient Greece, probably around the sixth century BC. Supposedly he was born a slave, somehow became a free man, but then met with a sorry end.

_PI,"UPI.    	United Press International was one of the biggest news agencies in the world, sending out news by wire to the major newspapers. It ran foul of the change in media formats at the end of the last century, and lost many of its clients as the afternoon newspapers shut down due to the advent of television news. UPI, which once employed thousands of people, still exists but with only a handful of employees."
STA_,"STAR.    	Back in the fifties there was competition for deciding on the design of the American flag when Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood. Most of the designs submitted were with 50 stars, as the assumption was that the 49-star flag would not be needed for long, if at all. 17-year-old Robert Heft submitted a 49-star design to his teacher for a school project, earning him a B-minus grade. Heft complained and was jokingly told that his grade would only be reconsidered if the design was accepted by congress. I guess Robert received his A because his flag flew from January 1959 when Alaska joined the union, until August when Hawaii became the 50th state. How cool is that?"
M_O,"MAO.    	Mao Zedong was born on December 16, 1893 in the Hunan Province of China. As Mao was the son of a peasant farmer, his prospects for education were limited. Indeed he left school at age 13 to work on the family farm but did eventually get to secondary school in Changsha, the provincial capital. In the years following, Mao continued his education in Beijing and actually turned down an opportunity to study in France."

TW_,"TWA.    	Trans World Airlines (TWA) was a big carrier in the US, but was perhaps even more recognized for its extensive presence in Europe and the Middle East. For many years, especially after the collapse of Pan-Am, TWA was considered the unofficial flag carrier for the US. The company started in 1930, the product of a forced merger of Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express. The Transcontinental and Western Air that resulted (the original meaning of the acronym TWA) was what the Postmaster General wanted, a bigger airline to which the Postal Service could award airmail contracts."
S_O,"SAO.    	SÃ£o Paulo is the largest city in Brazil. SÃ£o Paulo is also the city with the highest number of helicopters in the world. This is partly driven by the horrendous traffic jams in SÃ£o Paulo, but also by the wealthy having a very real fear of being kidnapped on the city's streets."

The modern GPS system that we use today was built by the US military who received the massive funding needed because of fears during the Cold War of the use of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. We civilians, all round the world, owe a lot to President Ronald Reagan because he directed the military to make GPS technology available to the public for the common good.

Over time, AltaVisa lost its way, trying to morph into a Web portal like Yahoo! and lost its identity as a search engine. Then, when no one was looking I guess, along comes Google in the late nineties, and shoves AltaVista off its pedestal in the search engine space. But, AltaVista is still around for search, and is now owned by Yahoo!"

E_M,"ELM.    	Yew is the wood of choice for the longbow, a valued weapon in the history of England. The alternative when yew is not available is Wych elm, also known as Scots elm. The longbow is constructed with a core of yew heartwood (as the heartwood resists compression) that has a sheath of yew sapwood (as the sapwood resists stretching). The yew was in such demand for longbows that for centuries yew trees were in short supply in Britain and the wood had to be imported from all over Europe."
A_H,"ASH.    	Yggdrasil is an enormous tree that is central to Norse mythology. It is known as ""the world tree"". It is thought that ""Yggdrasil"" is a yew tree, and that its name derives from the norse word ""igwja"" meaning ""yew-tree"", but it is disputed."
AT_AS,"ATLAS.    	Rand McNally is a company long associated with the city of Chicago. Its roots go back to 1856 when William Rand opened a printing shop in the city.

They diversified into ""railroad guides"" in 1870, a precursor of what was to be their big success, the road atlas. When automobile travel started to become significant, Rand and McNally turned their attention to roads and they published their first road map, of New York City in 1904. Rand and McNally really popularized the use of highway numbers, and indeed erected many roadside highway signs themselves, long before the state and federal authorities adopted the idea."
S_YX,"STYX.    	The River Styx in Greek mythology was the river that formed the boundary between the Earth and the Underworld (or Hades).

E_BA,"ELBA.    	I had a lovely two-week vacation in Tuscany once, including what was supposed to be a two-night stay on Elba.

RE_,"REX.    	The Tyrannosaurus rex (usually written T. rex) was a spectacular looking dinosaur.

And, did you know that Nora Ephron's second marriage was to journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame?"
TE_,"TEN.    	""Taps"" is played nightly by the US military, indicating ""lights out"". It's also known as ""Butterfield's Lulaby"" as it is a variation of an older bugle call called the ""Scott Tattoo"", arranged during the Civil War by the Union Army's Brigadier General Daniel Butterfield. The tune is called ""taps"", from the notion of drum taps, as it was originally played on a drum, and only later on a bugle."
A_SOP,"AESOP.    	Aesop lived in Ancient Greece, probably around the sixth century BC. Supposedly he was born a slave, somehow became a free man, but then met with a sorry end.

AE_,"AER.    	Aer Lingus, may favorite airline! Well, the service isn't great, to be honest, but when I get on board an Aer Lingus plane I feel like I am back in Ireland. Aer Lingus is the national airline of Ireland, with Aer Lingus being a phonetic spelling of the Irish ""aer-loingeas"" meaning ""air fleet"". These days it can only lay claim to the title of Ireland's oldest airline as it's no longer the biggest. That honor goes to the controversial Ryan Air."

ESSE_,ESSEN.    	The beautiful Villa HÃ¼gel is a mansion in Essen that was built by the Krupp family of industrialists. Alfred Krupp was imprisoned in a wing of the mansion for three years after WWII when he was convicted of using slave labor in his factories during the war.

The story was written just after 1600, so the game has been around at least since then. Twenty-one came to the US but wasn't all that popular so bonus payouts were introduced to create more interest. One of more noted bonuses was a ten-to-one payout to a player dealt an ace of spades and a black jack. This bonus led to the game adopting the moniker ""Blackjack""."

S_O,"SAO.    	SÃ£o Paulo is the largest city in Brazil. It is also the city with the highest number of helicopters in the world. This is partly driven by the horrendous traffic jams in SÃ£o Paulo, but also by the wealthy having a very real fear of being kidnapped on the city streets."

_AO,"MAO.    	Mao Zedong was born on December 16, 1893 in the Hunan Province of China. As Mao was the son of a peasant farmer, his prospects for education were limited.

In the years following, Mao continued his education in Beijing and actually turned down an opportunity to study in France."
N_R,"NPR.    	Chicago Public Radio produces one of my favorite radio shows, ""Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!"" It is indeed a fun game show, hosted by Peter Sagal.

R_I,"RPI.    	The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is a private school in Troy, New York. The university is named after its founder Stephen Van Rensselaer who set up the school in 1824.

Given that, the name for the sports teams is quite apt: the Engineers."
_MAX,"IMAX.    	The IMAX Corporation, which is behind the IMAX film format, is a Canadian company. The impetus for developing the system came after Expo '67 in Montreal. Back then large format screenings were accomplished using multiple projectors with multiple screens, with images basically stitched together.

_EX,"REX.    	In the excellent film ""Toy Story"", Rex is of course a tyrannosaurus, and a pretty clumsy one. He is voiced by actor Wallace Shawn, whose name is perhaps less familiar than his face. He played the neighbor on ""The Cosby Show"" as well as many, many other supporting roles on TV and the big screen."
