IO_S,"IONS.    	A cyclotron accelerates charged particles (ions) using a magnetic field, usually directing the particles round and round a huge, underground, circular structure."
R_AMS,"REAMS.    	I must admit that I find the slang term ""to ream"", with its meaning ""to scold harshly"", quite distasteful. The usage of the word as a reprimand dates back to about 1950."
AT_AR,"ATTAR.    	Attar is a fragrant essential oil obtained from flowers, and may particularly refer to attar of roses."
R_MY,"REMY.    	Remy Martin: my favorite cognac (remember that when it's my birthday!). In China, the name Remy Martin is not used, but rather the more colorful moniker, ""man-headed horse"", describing the centaur logo on the bottle."
N_IAD,"NAIAD.    	The Naiads of Greek mythology were water nymphs, associated with fountains, wells, springs and streams. The saltwater equivalents to the freshwater Naiads were the Oceanids."
HA_N,"HAWN.    	I remember watching the ditsy Goldie Hawn character on ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"". Hawn used to give great performances on the show, convincing everyone that she was the stereotypical dumb blonde. Well, what a career she was to carve out for herself!"
_RATOR,"ORATOR.    	Henry Clay was a statesman from Kentucky well known for his gift as an orator. He was very persuasive in his arguments in favor of war with Britain resulting in the War of 1812.

LA_,"LAE.    	Amelia Earhart is as famous today as she was during her lifetime. When she became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, she was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by Congress and the Cross of Knight of the Legion of Honor by the French government. She made two attempts to circumnavigate the globe by air (not solo). Her first attempt in March 1937 had to be abandoned when her aircraft was damaged during takeoff. The second attempt in June/July of the same year ended when Earhart and her navigator disappeared flying from Lae, New Guinea to Howland Island in the Central Pacific. There is an expedition planned for mid-2012 that has the goal of finding Earhart's plane in a reef near Gardner Island (now Nikamaror). Remains have been found on the island that may be Earhart's, and a photograph taken in 1937 is believed to show part of a plane's undercarriage sticking out of the water."
_GAL,"EGAL.    	""Egal"" is the French word for ""equal, alike"", and a word we sometimes use in English. The national motto of France is ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"", meaning ""Liberty, equality, fraternity (brotherhood)."

S_RTRE,"SARTRE.    	John-Paul Sartre was a leading French philosopher, as well as a writer and political activist. Sartre was one of the few people to have been awarded a Nobel Prize and refused to accept it. He was named winner of the prize for Literature in 1964, for his first novel ""Nausea"". Before his win, Sartre knew that his name was on the list of nominees so he wrote to the Nobel Institute and asked to be withdrawn from consideration. The letter somehow went unread, so he found himself having to refuse the award after he had been selected."
MER_,"MERV.    	Merv Griffin was quite the entertainer, truly a mogul in the business. He started his career as a singer on the radio during the big band era. In the sixties he hosted his own talk show, and then famously developed such great game shows as 'Jeopardy!' and 'Wheel of Fortune'."
_ALE,"BALE.    	The variety show 'Hee Haw' aired on CBS from 1969-1971, and then had a 20-year run in syndication. The show was built around country music, although the format was inspired by 'Rowan & Martin's Laugh In'."
FAR_I,"FARSI.    	""Farsi"" is one of the local names for Persian, an Iranian language."
ZE_IG,"ZELIG.    	""Zelig"" is a 1983 film by Woody Allen. It tells the fictitious story, in documentary style, of Leonard Zelig (played by Allen), who has the gift of being able to change his appearance in order to better fit in with the company he keeps.

_ENI,"LENI.    	Leni Riefenstahl was a German film director, actress and dancer. She was a noted figure moving in Adolf Hitler's circle, and her most famous film was a propaganda piece called ""Triumph of Will"". ""Triumph of the Will"" documents the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. We've all probably seen many excerpts, shots of huge crowds, Nazis marching with flags, and frenzied speeches from Hitler. Riefenstahl was arrested after the war and detained for a number of years but never found guilty of any crime. She lived a long life, a very long life. She was married for the second time in 2003, at the age of 101 years. She died just a few weeks later, as she had been suffering from cancer."
_YES,"LYES.    	Historically, lye was hydrated potash (potassium hydroxide). Nowadays when we purchase lye it is caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). Crystal Drano was developed in 1932 by one Harry Drackett, who produced the product in his own company until it was bought over in 1965 by Bristol Myers. The crystalline form of Drano is sodium hydroxide (lye) as well as sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The product works as the lye reacts with any fats in the clog forming soap. The lye also reacts with finely divided aluminum generating tremendous heat, creating boiling and churning so that any hair or other deposits are cut by the sharp edges of the crystals. Having said that, boiling water poured down the drain is often just as effective."
_CK,"ECK.    	Dennis Eckersley is a former baseball pitcher who goes by the nickname 'Eck'. Eckersley played for the Oakland Athletics from 1987 to 1995, and the team retired his uniform number (43) in 2005."
ME_LO,"MENLO.    	Menlo Park is a town in the San Francisco Bay Area. The town was built around land previously owned by two Irish immigrants. The pair called their property 'Menlo Park', naming it for Menlo in County Galway, which is where the Irishmen came from."

ST_N,"STUN.    	A MASER is a device that was around long before LASERs came into the public consciousness. A MASER (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is similar to a LASER, but microwaves are emitted rather than light waves. When the storyline for ""Star Trek"" was being developed, the writers introduced a weapon called a ""phaser"", with the name ""phaser"" derived from PHoton mASER."
KA_T,"KANT.    	Immanuel Kant was an 18th-century, German philosopher. Kant published ""Perpetual Peace"" in 1795, laying out what he believed were conditions for ending all wars and creating a lasting peace. The good news for us is that one of these conditions was to have a world full of constitutional republics, so it seems we are on the right track here in the US!"
K_TY,"KATY.    	""K-K-K-Katy"" is a song telling the story of a young soldier who stutters when he talks to girls. It was recorded by Billy Murray in 1918, and again by Mel Blanc of cartoon fame, in 1949 using the voice of Porky Pig."
_RABIC,"ARABIC.    	It's possible that 'coffee' comes from the Arabic 'qahwah', a word that may have meant coffee, or even wine."
_OAR,"BOAR.    	In Greek mythology Adonis is a beautiful young god loved by Aphrodite. Adonis dies in a hunting accident (gored by a boar), but not before he gives Aphrodite a child. Adonis was originally a Phoenician god ""absorbed"" into Greek lore (Phoenicia is modern day Lebanon). The child born of Adonis to Aphrodite was called Beroe, after which is named Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon."
ROD_N,RODIN.    	The Rodin Museum is my favorite of all the museums in Paris. The Musée Rodin is very special in that the building and garden that hold all of the works was once Auguste Rodin's actual home and studio. Well worth a visit if you're in the City of Lights ...
_LANIS,"ALANIS.    	Alanis Morissette is a Canadian singer-songwriter. After releasing two pop albums in Canada, in 1995 she recorded her first album to be distributed internationally. Called ""Jagged Little Pill"", it is a collection of songs with more of a rock influence.

A_AMS,ADAMS.    	Bryan Adams is a Canadian singer-songwriter. Adams is also a very accomplished photographer and his images have been widely published.
P_L,PAL.    	A crony is a friend or companion. The term originated as slang in Cambridge University in England in the 1600s. 'Crony' is probably derived from the Greek 'khronios' meaning 'long-lasting'.
SODO_,"SODOM.    	The two cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as Admah and Zeboim, were destroyed by God for the sins of their inhabitants, according to the Bible. The name Sodom (and Gomorrah) has become a metaphor for vice and homosexuality, and gives us our word ""sodomy""."
W_A,"WVA.    	The city of Morgantown in northern West Virginia is named for Zackquill Morgan who moved into the area in 1767. Zackquill&#8217;s father&#8217;s name was Morgan Morgan, so I guess the family liked the Morgan name &#8230;"
TOR_S,"TORTS.    	The word ""tort"" is a French word meaning ""mischief, injury or wrong"". Tort law is generally about negligence, when the action of one party causes injury to another but that action falls outside of the scope of criminal law."

_AGO,"PAGO.    	Pago Pago is the capital of American Samoa in the South Pacific. The island was used by the US Navy during WWII but managed to largely escape the conflict, with the only incident being shelling of the harbor at Pago Pago by a Japanese submarine. A more devastating event was the tsunami that hit Pago Pago and surrounding areas in 2009 causing widespread damage and numerous deaths."
_VR,"DVR.    	TiVo was introduced in 1999 and was the world's first commercially successful DVR (Digital Video Recorder). If you don't have a DVR, you might want to consider getting one. For those who enjoy television, it's very liberating ..."
_PHONE,"IPHONE.    	The Droid is the smartphone from Motorola, noted for running Google's Android operating system."
SKI_,"SKIT.    	'Burlesque' came into English from French, although the word is rooted in the Italian 'burla', the word for a joke, or mockery. A burlesque is work of literature, drama or music that is intended to amuse and cause laughter. Burlesques in the US took on a variety show format and were popular in the US from the 1860s. Over time, the variety acts started to include female striptease, and the term 'burlesque' has come to be associated mainly with such entertainment."
BO_ER,"BONER.    	""Boner"" is one of those terms that I just don't like because it can be used offensively. ""Boner"" can be used for a faux pas, an error."
_ADRE,MADRE.    	In Spanish a madre's (mother's) boy is a niño.
ELIXI_,ELIXIR.    	An elixir is a solution of alcohol and water that is used to deliver a medicine. The term 'elixir' can also be used to mean a medicine that has the power to cure all ills.
_AMIE,"MAMIE.    	Mamie Eisenhower has to have been one of the most charming of all the First Ladies of the United States. Ms. Eisenhower suffered from an inner ear disease called Ménière's disease which caused her to lose her balance quite often. Because she was unsteady on her feet, there were unfounded rumors floating around Washington that she had a drinking problem. People can be very unkind ..."
YOK_,YOKE.    	A yoke is that wooden beam used between a pair of oxen so that they are forced to work together.
_HEE,"RHEE.    	Syngman Rhee was born in Korea, but received much of his education in the US, including a Ph.D. from Princeton. He returned, very much westernized as this point, to Korea in 1910, a Korea that by then had been annexed by Japan. He found himself President of a Provisional Government of Korea based in Shanghai, but was eventually ousted for misuse of power. After WWII, the westernized Rhee was installed as President heavily backed by the United States. However, Rhee's rule proved to be more like tyranny, and during the Korean War, his relationship with the US Government became very strained. He stayed in power until 1960, when student revolts became popular enough to force him out of office. The CIA flew him out of the country, and he went into exile in Hawaii, where a few years later he died of a stroke."
DE_ST,"DEIST.    	Deism (from the Latin ""deus"" meaning god) is the belief that a supreme being created the universe, a belief based on observation and reason and without the need for faith. Further, a deist does not accept divine intervention, but rather believes that the supreme being having created the universe, leaves the world to it own devices."
AZ_RE,"AZURE.    	The word ""azure"" came into English from Persian via Old French. The French word ""l'azur"" was taken from the Persian name for a place in northeastern Afghanistan called ""Lazhward"" which was the main source of the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli. The stone has a vivid blue color, and ""azure"" has been describing this color since the 14th century."
MAZ_,"MAZE.    	Did you know that IKEA was founded by Ingvar Kamprad in 1943 when he was just 17-years-old??!! IKEA is an acronym that stands for Ingvar Kamprad Elmtaryd Agunnaryd (don't forget now!). Elmtaryd was the name of the farm where Ingvar Kamprad grew up, and Agunnaryd is his home parish in Sweden."
I_INA,"IRINA.    	Anton Chekhov wrote his play ""Three Sisters"" using as his inspiration the lives of the three Bronte sisters and their brother. Irina is the youngest of the sisters."

The film adaptation was released in 1978, starring Diana Ross and Michael Jackson, with Jackson playing the Scarecrow. I haven't seen it. ""The Wizard of Oz"" scares me. The flying monkeys creep me out. There, I have admitted it ..."
CE_SNA,"CESSNA.    	The Cessna Aircraft manufacturing company was founded in 1911 by Clyde Cessna, a farmer from Kansas. Cessna is headquartered in Wichita and today has over 8,000 employees."

_GI,"TGI.    	T.G.I. Friday's is an American restaurant chain, founded in 1965 in New York City. Today there are over a thousand T.G.I. Friday's restaurants in over 50 countries. I think they have always been particularly successful overseas. I used visit one a lot with my family when we lived in the Philippines, and I believe the most successful Friday's restaurant anywhere in the world is the one in Haymarket Leicester Square in London in the UK."
APOL_O,APOLLO.    	The Cortile del Belvedere (the Belvedere courtyard) was a magnificent architectural design in the Vatican Palace in Rome that could be seen for most of the 16th century.

_ME,AME.    	'Ame' is the French for 'soul'.
_MV,"DMV.    	In most states, the government agency responsible for vehicle registration and the issuing of drivers licenses is called the DMV, which usually stands for the Department of Motor Vehicles, but there are ""variations on the theme"". For example, in Arizona the responsible agency is called the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD), and in Colorado the familiar acronym DMV stands for ""Division"" of Motor Vehicles."
ELK_,"ELKO.    	The city of Elko came into being in 1868 as a settlement built around the eastern end of a railway line constructed from California, heading for Utah. When the line was extended, the construction crews moved on, and Elko remained."

_ENCE,"PENCE.    	I remember the days when there used to be 240 pence (pennies) in an Irish/British pound. Life became so much easier when that was changed to 100 ""new pence"" in 1971."
BLIN_,"BLINI.    	A blintz (also 'blin', plural 'blini') is a thin pancake similar to a crêpe, although unlike a crêpe a blintz may contain yeast."
_EX,"MEX.    	The official name of the US's neighbor to the south is the United Mexican States. The country is named after its capital, Mexico City, and not the other way round."
O_TS,"OTTS.    	Steve Ott is a Canadian hockey player, in the Dallas Stars line-up. Before becoming a hockey pro, Steve Ott raced outboard hydroplanes in the American Power Boat Association, following in the footsteps of his Dad, a National Champion."
JO_D,"JOAD.    	Tom Joad is a character in John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"". The role of Joad is played by Henry Fonda in the 1940 film adaptation directed by John Ford. Ford's movie has a place in history, as it was one of the first 25 movies selected for preservation by the Library of Congress in the US National Film Registry."
C_EOPATRA,"CLEOPATRA.    	The 1963 movie ""Cleopatra"" really was an epic work. It was the highest grossing film of the year, taking in $26 million dollars at the box office, yet it still lost money. The original budget for the film was just $2 million, but so many things went wrong that the final cost swelled to a staggering $44 million dollars, making it the second most expensive movie ever made (taking into account inflation). Elizabeth Taylor was supposed to earn a record amount of $1 million for the film, and ended up earning seven times that amount due to delays. But she paid dearly as she became seriously ill during shooting and had to have an emergency tracheotomy to save her life. The scar in her throat can actually be seen in some of the shots in the film."
TEAS_,"TEASE.    	Not so much here in America, but over in the British Isles ""blowing a raspberry"" is a way of insulting someone (I think it's called ""a Bronx cheer"" in the US). The verb ""razz"" is a shortened form of ""raspberry""."
NI_,"NIM.    	Nim is just that, an archaic term meaning to pilfer or to steal."
T_I,"TGI.    	T.G.I. Friday's is an American restaurant chain, founded in 1965 in New York City. Today they have over a thousand restaurants in over 50 countries. I think they have always been particularly successful overseas. I used to go there a lot with my family when we lived in the Philippines, and I believe the most successful Friday's restaurant anywhere in the world is the one in Haymarket Leicester Square in London in the UK."
_IJOE,"GI JOE.    	G.I. Joe was the original ""action figure"", the first toy to carry that description. G.I. Joe first hit the shelves in 1964. There have been a few movies based on the G.I. Joe figure, but, more famous than all of them I would say is the 1997 movie ""G.I. Jane"" starring Demi Moore in the title role. I think this movie had some potential, to be honest, but it really did not deliver at all."
BE_OP,"BEBOP.    	""Be-Bop-A-Lula"" is an early rock and roll song, recorded in 1956 by Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps. The unusual name is probably related to the song ""Be-Baba-Leba"" recorded just over ten years earlier, in 1945 by Helen Humes. Both these titles derive from a similar sounding phrase common in jazz circles in the forties, which gave the name to the ""bebop"" style of music. And the original jazz term ""bebop"" probably came from ""Arriba! Arriba!"", words of encouragement from Latin American bandleaders to their musicians."
N_LAN,"NOLAN.    	Director Christopher Nolan is best known for ""rescuing"" the floundering Batman movie franchise. He directed ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight""."

PC_,"PCS.    	The giant multinational called HP (originally Hewlett-Packard) was founded in 1939 with an investment of $538, in a one-car garage in Palo Alto, California by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. The company name would been Packard-Hewlett had Dave Packard won a coin toss!"
WEB_R,"WEBER.    	In 1952 George Stephen was working for the Weber Brothers Metal works in Chicago. One of the company's products was a line of half-spheres that were welded together to make buoys used in Lake Michigan. Stephens took two of these metal hemispheres and converted them into the original kettle grill. Weber set up a barbecue division that Stephens ran, and Stephen became so successful that he bought out the Weber Brothers factory, and converted all production to the manufacture of grills."
DI_ERO,"DINERO.    	Dinero is the Spanish word for money, as well as a slang term for money here in the US."
WA_A,WAWA.    	I want water!

GR_S,GRES.    	Passing the Graduate Record Examination is usually a requirement for entry into graduate school here in the US.

LER_Y,"LEROY.    	'Sleigh Ride' is the signature tune of the Boston Pops Orchestra, which first recorded it in 1949. The tune was composed by Leroy Anderson in 1948."
J_Y,"JAY.    	""The Simpsons"" is one of the most successful programs produced by the Fox Broadcasting Company. Homer Simpson's catchphrase is ""D'oh"", such a famous exclamation nowadays that it has been included in the OED since 2001."
G_A,"GIA.    	Gia Carangi was a fashion model, often described as the world's first supermodel. Carangi was from Philadelphia, and had her first modelling jobs appearing in newspaper ads. She started to abuse heroin in 1980, at 20 years of age. She contracted AIDS, and died at 26 years old. Carangi was one of the first famous women to succumb to the disease, in 1986."
LA_I,LANI.    	Lani Guinier was the first African-American woman to achieve tenure at Harvard Law School.
CER_S,"CERTS.    	Certs was the first breath mint to be marketed nationally in the US, hitting the shelves in 1956. It's called a mint, but it isn't really as it contains no mint oil, but instead its famous ingredient named ""Retsyn""."
COSM_,"COSMO.    	Like so many famous cocktails, the actual origins of the cosmopolitan are disputed. It is a nice drink though. One of the standard recipes is 4 parts citrus vodka, 1.5 parts Cointreau, 1.5 parts lime juice and 3 parts cranberry juice."
S_ARIF,"SHARIF.    	""Che!"" is a 1969 biopic about the life of Che Guevara. It stars Omar Sharif in the title role, and Jack Palance as Fidel Castro. I haven't seen the film, but apparently it wasn't well received. Well, an Egyptian (Sharif) playing an Argentine Marxist, and a Ukrainian American (Palance) playing a Cuban revolutionary ... it sounds like a disaster waiting to happen ..."
_LEA,"PLEA.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), but, in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also only mnemonics, introduced after the Morse signal was adopted."
LA_,"LAD.    	""A Shropshire Lad"" is a collection of poems published in 1896, written by the English poet A. E. Housman. Housman couldn't find a publisher for his work, so he had to use his own money to get the collection in print. The poems all hark back to the simple life of a young man in rural England. The collection gained in popularity as young men went overseas to fight in the Second Boer War, and then in WWI. The nostalgic themes struck a chord with the young soldiers. The was especially true of the most famous poem in the collection, ""To an Athlete Dying Young"", with its story of a young man cut off in his prime."
M_DEA,"MEDEA.    	In Greek mythology Medea was the wife of Jason, the heroic leader of the Argonauts."
XK_S,"XKES.    	Jaguar started out as a manufacturer of sidecars for motorcycles back in 1922, when the company was known as the Swallow Sidecar Company (SS for short). The company changed its name to Jaguar after WWII, because of the unfortunate connotations of the the letters ""SS"" at that time."
N_WYORK,NEW YORK.    	What is the only state name in the Union ending with the letter 'K'?
_ZURE,"AZURE.    	The word ""azure"" came into English from Persian via Old French.
