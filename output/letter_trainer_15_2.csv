Dreyfus was a Jewish military officer in the French army, falsely accused and convicted of spying for Germany. Even after the error was discovered, the government refused to back down, choosing to let Dreyfus rot away on Devil's Island rather than admit to the mistake. It wasn't until 1906, 12 years after the wrongful conviction, that Dreyfus was freed and reinstated, largely due to the advocacy of Emile Zola."

G_RE,"GORE.    	The 2004 movie ""Saw"" (and it's seemingly endless sequels) is a horror film directed by James Wan, who also came up with the gruesome storyline.

I've seen trailers, but that is far as I will go with this kind of thing."
SH_,"SHA.    	Do you remember the band ""Johnny Casino & The Gamblers"" in the movie ""Grease""? That was actually the real-world group Sha Na Na.

Our word ""pajamas"" comes to us from the Indian subcontinent, where ""pai jamahs"" were loose fitting pants tied at the waist and worn at night by locals, and ultimately by the Europeans living there.

While the UN was working towards a trusteeship administration for Korea, the Soviet Union managed the Korean Peninsula north of the 38th parallel and the US managed the south. The UN's plans came to naught as the Cold War dictated the establishment of the two separate states of North Korea and South Korea. North Korea invaded the South in 1950, leading to the Korean War.

E_AS,"ERAS.    	When looking back at the 1890s, here in America we sometimes refer to the era as the Gay Nineties.

The name 'Argentina' of course comes from the Latin 'argentum', the word for 'silver'.

Those early explorers got hold of lots of silver objects that they found among the native population."

M_ATA,"MIATA.    	The Mazda MX-5 is sold as the Miata in North America, and as the Roadster in Japan. I've always liked the looks of the Mazda Miata, probably because it reminds me so much of old British sports cars. The Miata is built in Hiroshima, Japan."
_ESCI,"PESCI.    	Joe Pesci got his big break in movies with a supporting role in 'Raging Bull' starring Robert De Niro, earning Pesci an Oscar nomination early in his career. There followed a string of gangster roles played alongside De Niro, namely 'Once Upon a Time in America', 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino'. But I like Pesci's comedic acting best of all. He was marvelous in the 'Home Alone' films, the 'Lethal Weapon' series, and my personal favorite, 'My Cousin Vinny'. Pesci gets a mention in the stage musical 'Jersey Boys', which isn't too surprising as he is one of the show's producers."
_APAS,"TAPAS.    	""Tapa"" is the Spanish word for ""lid"", and there is no clear rationale for why this word came to be used for an appetizer. There are lots of explanations cited, all of which seem to involve the temporary covering of one's glass of wine with a plate or item of food to either preserve the wine or give one extra space at the table."
_ETI,SETI.    	SETI is the name given to a number of projects that are searching for extraterrestrial life. The acronym stands for 'search for extraterrestrial intelligence'.

Nin and Pole had their marriage annulled in 1966, but just for legal reasons, and they continued to live together as husband and wife until Nin passed away in 1977."
NE_A,"NENA.    	Nena is a German singer (""Nena"" became the name of her band as well) who had a big hit with one of my favorite songs of the eighties ""99 Luftballons"". The English translation of the German title (""99 Red Balloons"") isn't literal, with the color ""red"" added just so that the title had the right number of syllables for the tune. ""Luftballon"" is the name given to a child's toy balloon in German."
_IE,"LIE.    	We are most familiar with the term 'polygraph' as the generic name for a lie detector instrument. This usage began in 1921, although the term had been around since the end of the 18th century.

The particular episode in question has a bizarre storyline culminating in Fonzie and Mork having a thumb-to-finger duel. Eventually Richie wakes up in bed, and alien Mork was just part of a dream! Oh, and ""Nanu Nanu"" means both ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" back on the planet Ork. ""I am Mork from Ork, Nanu Nanu"". Great stuff ..."
A_TOR,"ASTOR.    	The Astor Library in the East Village of New York City was founded in 1854 by the country's first multi-millionaire, John Jacob Astor. The library's collection was moved to the New York Public Library some years ago, and today the stylish building houses the Public Theater."

_FC,"KFC.    	The famous ""Colonel"" of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame was Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur from Henryville, Indiana. Although not really a ""Colonel"", Sanders did indeed serve in the military. He enlisted in the Army as a private in 1906 at the age of 16, lying about his age. He spent the whole of his time in the Army as a soldier in Cuba. It was much later, in the 1930s, that Sanders went into the restaurant business making his specialty deep-fried chicken. By 1935 his reputation as a ""character"" had grown, so much so that Governor Ruby Laffoon of Kentucky gave Sanders the honorary title of ""Kentucky Colonel"". Later in the fifties, Sanders developed his trademark look with the white suit, string tie, mustache and goatee. When Sanders was 65 however, his business failed and in stepped Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's. Thomas simplified the Sanders menu, cutting it back from over a hundred items to just fried chicken and salads. That was enough to launch KFC into the fast food business. Sanders sold the US franchise in 1964 for just $2 million and moved to Canada to grow KFC north of the border. He died in 1980 and is buried in Louisville, Kentucky. The Colonel's secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices is indeed a trade secret. Apparently there is only one copy of the recipe, a handwritten piece of paper, written in pencil and signed by Colonel Sanders. Since 2009, the piece of paper has been locked in a computerized vault surrounded with motion detectors and security cameras."

AB_,"ABS.    	The abdominal muscles ('abs') are more correctly referred to as the rectus abdominis muscles. They are together referred to as a 'six-pack' in a person who has developed the muscles and who has low body fat. In my case, more like a keg ..."

_SAIR,"USAIR.    	From 1953, what today is US Airways was called Allegheny Airlines. In the seventies, customers became very dissatisfied with the company's service levels as it struggled to manage a rapid expansion in its number of flights. These problems earned the airline the nickname 'Agony Air'. Allegheny tried to leave the 'agony' behind in 1979 and changed its name to USAir. In 1997 the name was changed again, to US Airways. US Airways merged with American Airlines in 2013, and the 'US Airways' brand name was gradually replaced with 'American Airlines'."

EN_RE,"ENTRE.    	""Entre nous"" is French for ""between us""."

SEP_A,"SEPIA.    	Sepia is that lovely rich, brown-grey color so common in old photographs. ""Sepia"" is the Latinized version of the Greek word for cuttlefish, as sepia pigment is derived from the ink sac of the cuttlefish.The ""sepia tone"" of old photographs is not the result of deterioration over time. Rather, it is the result of a deliberate preservation process which converts the metallic silver in the photographic image to a more stable silver sulfide. Prints that have been sepia-toned can last in excess of 150 years."
K_IS,"KRIS.    	Kris Kardashian is the matriarch of the Kardashian clan. She was married to the lawyer Robert Kardashian who was one of O. J. Simpson's lawyers in his 1995 murder trial.

_ET,"MET.    	The New York Mets baseball team was founded in 1962, a replacement for two teams that the city had lost, namely the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants.

P_C,"PAC.    	Pac-12 is an abbreviation for the Pacific-12 Conference, a college athletic conference in the western US.

You'll see dovetail joints in drawers around the house."

MD_,MDS.    	Medical doctor (MD)
ESTO_,"ESTOP.    	The term ""estop"" means to block or stop by using some legal device. The word ""estop"" comes from Old French, in which ""estopper"" means ""to stop up"" or ""to impede""."

AC_E,"ACNE.    	The Proactiv range of skincare products were introduced in 1995 by two dermatologists who met up with each other while studying at Stanford. Proactiv is market to people suffering with acne. There are quite a few folks who complain about the direct marketing approach to sales used for the products. Customers are 'members' of a club, and the products keep coming until a subscription is canceled."
_THANE,"ETHANE.    	The main component in natural gas is methane, with the second most voluminous constituent being ethane. Both methane and ethane are combustible, and so traditionally the methane and ethane were burned together to generate heat. However, since the sixties, ethane has been used as a valuable starter material for the production of ethylene, itself a raw material for polyethylene and other plastics. So, these days the ethane is extracted at a refinery before the natural gas is bottled as a fuel."
N_NU,"NANU.    	""Mork & Mindy"" was broadcast from 1978 to 1982. We were first introduced to Mork (played by Robin Williams, of course) in a special episode of ""Happy Days"". The particular episode in question has a bizarre storyline culminating in Fonzie and Mork having a thumb-to-finger duel. Eventually Richie wakes up in bed, and alien Mork was just part of a dream! Oh, and ""Nanu Nanu"" means ""hello"" back on the planet Ork. ""I am Mork from Ork, Nanu Nanu"". Great stuff ..."
F_U,"FLU.    	Influenza (flu) is an ailment that is caused by a virus. The virus is readily inactivated by the use of soap, so washing hands and surfaces is especially helpful in containing flu outbreaks."

_SAIR,"USAIR.    	From 1953, what today is US Airways was called Allegheny Airlines. In the seventies, customers became very dissatisfied with the company's service levels as it struggled to manage a rapid expansion in its number of flights. These problems earned the airline the nickname 'Agony Air'. Allegheny tried to leave the 'agony' behind in 1979 and changed its name to USAir. In 1997 the name was changed again, to US Airways."

_ENA,"NENA.    	Nena is a German singer (""Nena"" became the name of her band as well) who had a big hit with one of my favorite songs of the eighties ""99 Luftballons"". The English translation of the German title (""99 Red Balloons"") isn't literal, with the color ""red"" added just so that the title had the right number of syllables for the tune. ""Luftballon"" is the name given to a child's toy balloon in German."
ERI_U,"ERI TU.    	The aria ""Eri tu"" is from Verdi's opera ""Un ballo in maschera"" (A Masked Ball). The opera tells the story of the assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden during a masked ball."

MI_TA,"MIATA.    	The Mazda MX-5 is sold as the Miata in North America, and as the Roadster in Japan. I've always liked the looks of the Mazda Miata, probably because it reminds me so much of old British sports cars. The Miata is built in Hiroshima, Japan."
_HIA,"SHIA.    	The Islamic sects of Sunni and Shia Muslims differ in the belief of who should have taken over leadership of the Muslim faithful after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Followers of the Sunni tradition agree with the decision that the Prophet Muhammad's confidant Abu Bakr was the right choice to become the first Caliph of the Islamic nation. Followers of the Shia tradition believe that leadership should have stayed within the Prophet Muhammad's own family, and favoured the Prophet's son-in-law Ali."

The capital city of Freetown was originally set up as a colony to house the ""Black Poor"" of London, England.

Perhaps to help the impoverished souls, perhaps to rid the streets of ""a problem"", three ships were chartered in 1787 to transport a groups of blacks, with some whites, to a piece of land purchased in Sierra Leone. Those who made the voyage were guaranteed British citizenship and protection. The descendants of these immigrants, and others who made the journey over the next 60 years, make up the ethnic group that's today called the Sierra Leone Creole."
RM_,RMS.    	Room (rms.)
D_NO,"DINO.    	Dean Martin was the stage name of singer and actor Dino Crocetti. Martin was famous for his numerous hit songs such as 'That's Amore', 'Volare' and Everybody Loves Somebody', as well as his film career with Jerry Lewis.

Both methane and ethane are combustible, and so traditionally the methane and ethane from natural gas were burned together to generate heat.

So, these days the ethane is extracted at a refinery before the natural gas is bottled as a fuel."

After opening that first establishment, Bell bought up some more restaurants including four named El Taco. He sold off the El Taco restaurants but used the name in part when he opened his first Taco Bell in 1962. Bell sold then sold franchises, with the 100th Taco Bell opening in 1967. The ex-Marine sold off the whole chain to PepsiCo in 1978, and I am guessing he made a pretty penny."
_APAS,"TAPAS.    	""Tapa"" is the Spanish word for ""lid"", and there is no clear rationale for why this word came to be used for an appetizer.

Deservedly so, it is the longest running musical in the history of Broadway. And now there is a sequel, which I would dearly love to see, so let's hope it gets over here soon.

ARD_N,"ARDEN.    	The Forest of Arden is the setting for Shakespeare's 'As You Like It'.

Followers of the Sunni tradition agree with the decision that the Prophet Muhammad's confidante Abu Bakr was the right choice to become the first Caliph of the Islamic nation.

Although not really a ""Colonel"", Sanders did indeed serve in the military. He enlisted in the Army as a private in 1906 at the age of 16, lying about his age. He spent the whole of his time in the Army as a soldier in Cuba. It was much later, in the 1930s, that Sanders went into the restaurant business making his specialty deep-fried chicken. By 1935 his reputation as a ""character"" had grown, so much so that Governor Ruby Laffoon of Kentucky gave Sanders the honorary title of ""Kentucky Colonel"". Later in the fifties, Sanders developed his trademark look with the white suit, string tie, mustache and goatee. When Sanders was 65 however, his business failed and in stepped Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's. Thomas simplified the Sanders menu, cutting it back from over a hundred items to just fried chicken and salads. That was enough to launch KFC into the fast food business. Sanders sold the US franchise in 1964 for just $2 million and moved to Canada to grow KFC north of the border. He died in 1980 and is buried in Louisville, Kentucky. The Colonel's secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices is indeed a trade secret. Apparently there is only one copy of the recipe, a handwritten piece of paper, written in pencil and signed by Colonel Sanders. Since 2009, the piece of paper has been locked in a computerized vault surrounded with motion detectors and security cameras."

NE_A,"NENA.    	Nena is a German singer (""Nena"" became the name of her band as well) who had a big hit with one of my favorite songs of the eighties ""99 Luftballons"". The English translation of the German title (""99 Red Balloons"") isn't literal, with the color ""red"" added just so that the title had the right number of syllables for the tune. ""Luftballon"" is the name given to a child's toy balloon in German."

The UN's plans came to nothing as the Cold War dictated the establishment of the two separate states of North Korea and South Korea. North Korea invaded the South in 1950, leading to the Korean War.

That line runs diagonally across the 38th parallel, and is better known as the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)."

That first appearance was so successful, that the episode was adapted for the stage in 1962, starring Thomas Mitchell in the role.

_ED,"IED.    	Sadly, having spent much of my life in the border areas between southern and Northern Ireland, I am all too familiar with Improvised Explosive Devices, and their devastating effect.

Of course these days IEDs are very much in the news in Iraq and Afghanistan."

This is called the Theme Building and I believe it is mainly used as a restaurant and observation deck for the public. The airport used to be identified by the letters 'LA' but, when the aviation industry went to a three-letter standard for airport identification, this was changed to 'LAX'.

The memorial was designed by Henry Bacon, and the sculptor of the magnificent statue of President Lincoln was Daniel Chester French.
