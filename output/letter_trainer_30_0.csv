DRLA_,"DR LAO.    	""The Circus of Dr. Lao"" is a novel by Charles G. Finney, first published in 1935. There was a famous film adaptation released in 1964 called ""7 Faces of Dr. Lao"" starring Tony Randall in the title role. Randall wasn't the first choice, as the director wanted Peter Sellers for the part. However, MGM insisted on an American lead, and a great choice it turned out to be."
DERALT_,"DER ALTE.    	Konrad Adenauer was the first Chancellor of West Germany after WWII, taking office in 1949 at the age of 73. Adenauer was 87 years old when he left office. Understandably perhaps, his nickname was 'Der Alte', German for 'the old man'. Adenauer spent much of WWII in prison, courtesy of Herr Hitler."
TU_AS,"TUNAS.    	Skipjack tuna would be called medium sized, growing to about three feet long. Albacore tuna is a little larger."

Exxon merged with Mobil (yet another descendant of Standard Oil) in 1999, forming ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil is headquartered in Irving, Texas, which is located within the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex."
_IZA,"LIZA.    	Liza of Lambeth' was the first novel from the pen of English writer W. Somerset Maugham. It's the story of 18-year old factory work Liza Kemp from the Lambeth district of London, following her for the last four months of her tragic life. It's a sad tale of brutality towards towards women. At the time of writing, Maugham was working as a doctor at a hospital in Lambeth, which back then was very much a working class area."
CARD_,"CARDS.    	The St. Louis Cardinals baseball team was originally called the ""Brown Stockings"", changing their name to the ""Perfectos"" in 1899. The new name obviously didn't go down well with the locals, as the owners changed it one year later to the Cardinals."
HA_S,"HAAS.    	Tommy Haas is German-American tennis player. He grew up in Hamburg and, like many promising tennis players, moved to Florida to develop his tennis skills, at the age of 13."
VE_P,"VEEP.    	The official residence of the VP of the United States is at Number One Observatory Circle, in the grounds of the Naval Observatory. The house was built in 1893 for the use of the superintendent of the observatory. In 1974 it was taken over by Act of Congress for use as the VP's official residence. The move was partly a matter of economics as the cost of providing security for the Vice President at his own residence was becoming prohibitive. Reportedly, there was an underground bunker build below the house after the 9/11 attacks."
DISN_Y,"DISNEY.    	Radio Disney is mainly a music radio station, aimed at young people. It was launched in 1996, and is still going today. One nice feature, I think, is ""Playhouse Disney"" aired on weekdays. Although Playhouse Disney features music, it goes beyond that with stories, interviews and question & answer sessions."
TILE_,"TILES.    	Rummikub is a game invented in Israel. It was once the country's leading exported game and indeed was very popular in the US in the late seventies. The game uses elements of rummy, dominoes, mah-jongg and chess. I've never played it, but I think I might pick up a set some time soon and try it out ..."
BDA_,B-DAY.    	Happy birthday ...
BL_B,"BLOB.    	The 1958 horror film ""The Blob"" was the first movie in which Steve McQueen had a leading role. ""The Blob"" wasn't a success at all, until Steve McQueen became a star that is. Using McQueen's name, the movie was re-released and gained a cult following and was particularly successful at drive-in theaters."
MOLOT_V,"MOLOTOV.    	Vyacheslav Molotov was a prominent Soviet politician and protégé of Joseph Stalin. During the Winter War of WWII, between the Soviet Union and Finland, Molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that Finland was not being bombed, but rather that the Soviet Union was dropping food to relieve famine. With a sense of irony, the Finns started to call the Soviet bombs ""Molotov bread baskets"". The Finns also improvised incendiary bombs using bottles and a gasoline-based fuel, and called these devices ""Molotov cocktails"", a name that persists to this day."
ASY_,"AS YE.    	The commonly quoted line ""As ye sow, so shall ye reap"" is not actually a direct quote from the Bible, although the sentiment is expressed there at least twice. In the Book of Job is the line ""They that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same"". In the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians is the line ""Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap""."
_OOMS,"BOOMS.    	SuperSonic Transports, like the Concorde, broke Mach 1, the speed of sound. As a plane flies through air, it creates pressure waves in front (and behind) rather like the bow and stern waves of a boat. These pressure waves travel at the speed of sound, so as an aircraft itself accelerates towards the speed of sound it catches up with the pressure waves until they cannot ""get out of the way"". When the aircraft reaches the speed of sound, the compressed waves merge into one single shock wave, creating a sonic boom."
FANT_,"FANTA.    	The soft drink ""Fanta"" has quite an interesting history. As WWII approached, the Coca-Cola plant in Germany had trouble obtaining the ingredients it needed to continue production of the cola beverage, so the plant manager decided to create a new drink from what was available. The new beverage was built around whey (left over from cheese production) and pomace (left over after juice has been extracted from fruit). The inventor asked his colleagues to use their imagination (""Fantasie"" in German) and come up with a name for the drink, so they piped up ""Fanta!"""
SCAL_WAG,"SCALAWAG.    	Scallywag is actually a term we use in Ireland to describe a rogue, usually one that is harmless, and it comes from the Irish word ""sgaileog"" meaning a farm servant. The American use of scalawag as a rogue was borrowed as a nickname for southern white people that supported reconstruction after the Civil War."
H_TT,"HUTT.    	Jabba the Hutt is the big blob of an alien that appears in the ""Star Wars"" movie ""The Return of the Jedi"". His claim to fame is that he enslaved Princess Leia and kitted her out in that celebrated metal bikini."
C_X,"COX.    	The coxswain of a boat is one in charge, particularly of its steering and navigation. The name is shortened to ""cox"" particularly when used for the person steering and calling out the stroke in a competition rowing boat."
IMALOSE_,"I'M A LOSER.    	John Lennon wrote ""I'm a Loser"". He once said in an interview, with reference to the song, ""Part of me suspects I'm a loser and part of me thinks I'm God Almighty."" Typical John Lennon humor, I'd say ..."
HER_Z,"HERTZ.    	The Hertz car rental company was started in 1918 by Walter L. Jacobs in Chicago. He began with just twelve model T Ford cars available for rent. In 1923, the car rental operation was bought out by John D. Hertz who incorporated it into his truck and coach manufacturing company."

HO_X,HOAX.    	Don't believe what you hear. Crop circles are hoaxes ...
TH_NATURAL,"THE NATURAL.    	Bernard Malamud wrote the novel ""The Natural"", published in 1952. I tells the story of a baseball player called Roy Hobbs, who gets shot early in his career and makes a remarkable comeback many years later. Although Roy Hobbs is a fictional character, the story is apparently based on the real-life Phillies player Eddie Waitkus, who was indeed shot in his hotel room by an obsessed fan in 1949. The film adaptation released in 1984 is an excellent movie starring Robert Redford as ""The Natural""."
KAO_,"KAOS.    	The satirical comedy series called ""Get Smart"" was the creation of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, and starred Don Adams as Agent 86, Maxwell Smart. Agent 86 worked for the spy agency CONTROL, alongside the lovely Agent 99. CONTROL's sworn enemy was the criminal organization called KAOS. Smart's shoe phone was a hilarious prop used in almost every episode. When Smart dialed the number 117, the shoe converted into a gun. Cool stuff ..."
_ICA,FICA.    	The Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) was introduced in the 1930s as part of President Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal. FICA payments are made by both employees and employers in order to fund Social Security and Medicare.
_TEAL,STEAL.    	That would be in baseball.
A_INES,"A-LINES.    	Christian Dior introduced the term A-Line to the world of fashion with his 1955 collection. Prior to this, he described his pencil skirts as ""H-Line""."
EL_YNE,"ELAYNE.    	Elayne Boosler is a stand-up comedian, and was one of the first female comedians to have her act aired as a special on cable television. She does have some funny lines. Here's one I like:"

VER_I,"VERDI.    	Giuseppe Verdi's opera ""La Traviata"" was originally titled ""Violetta"" after the main character in the piece. The title ""La Traviata"" translates into ""The Woman Gone Astray"", reflecting Violetta's life as a courtesan."
S_PH,"SOPH.    	The term 'sophomore' has been used for a student in the second year of university since the 1680's. The original meaning of the word was 'arguer'. The term has Greek roots, from two Greek words that have been artificially combined in English. The Greek 'sophos' means 'wise', and 'moros' means 'foolish'."
_LOR,"FLOR.    	Flor de Cana is a brand of rum made in Nicaragua. Apparently, it is very well respected."
_ODGE,"DODGE.    	The phrase 'get out of Dodge', meaning 'scram, flee', is a reference to Dodge City, Kansas. The phrase became a cliche on TV westerns (mainly 'Gunsmoke', I think) and was then popularized by teenagers in the sixties and seventies."
_OSANNE,"ROSANNE.    	Rosanne Cash is the eldest daughter of Johnny Cash, a successful singer in her own right."
CHIN_,"CHINO.    	Chino is a twill cloth most often used to make hard-wearing pants. The pants have come to be referred to as chinos. Chino cloth was originally developed for use by the military, but quickly became popular with civilians."
ETO_LE,"ETOILE.    	In the world of ballet, the étoile is the leading dancer in a company (male or female). ""Étoile"" is the French word for ""star""."
S_ATES,"STATES.    	On political maps, red states are Republican, and blue states Democrat. The designations of red and blue states is a very recent concept, introduced in the 2000 presidential election by TV journalist, the late Tim Russert. In retrospect, the choice of colors is surprising, as in other democracies around the world, red is usually used to describe left-leaning, socialist parties (the reds under the bed!), and blue is used for conservative, right-wing parties."
ENN_O,"ENNIO.    	Ennio Morricone is an Italian composer and conductor, famous for composing scores for television and film. Perhaps his most recognizable works are the scores from the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, such as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""A Fistful of Dollars"". Other famous movie scores penned by Morricone include """"The Untouchables"", ""Cinema Pardiso"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America""."
BABE_,"BABES.    	""Babes in Toyland"" is an operetta by Victor Herbert, first performed in 1903 in Chicago. The musical play ""The Wizard of Oz"" had appeared on Broadway the prior year and was a resounding hit, so the creators of ""Babes in Toyland"" wanted to cash in on that success by producing something in the same genre. While not as big a hit as ""Oz"", the show did very well, playing for 192 performances, and is still produced today. The basic storyline makes use of various characters from the Mother Goose nursery rhymes, wound into a Christmas entertainment."
_MARI,"IMARI.    	Imari is a port city located on the island of Kyushi in Japan. What Europeans know as Imari porcelain actually isn't made in Imari, but rather in the nearby town of Arita. The name Imari was given to the porcelain because it was the port through which the ceramic ware was shipped. In Japan, the porcelains are called Arita-yaki."
"_,THE","I, THE.    	""I, The Jury"" is the first novel in the Mike Hammer series, written by Mickey Spillane. The story was filmed twice, once in 1953, and again in 1982 starring Armand Assante as Mike Hammer."

Indeed, one of my favorite recordings of the instructive 'Peter and the Wolf' by Prokofiev, is conducted and narrated by Bernstein."
DINE_,"DINER.    	""Hash"", meaning a dish of beef and vegetables mashed together, is a very American term, and one that really surprised me when I first came across it. ""Hash"" just seems like such an unappetizing item, but I soon found out how delicious it was. The name ""hash"" in this context comes from the French ""hacher"" meaning ""to chop"". Back in the early 1900s the dish called ""hashed browned potatoes"" was developed, which quickly morphed into ""hashbrowns"". From there the likes of corned beef hash was introduced."
EV_,"EVO.    	Evo Morales has been President of Bolivia since 2006. Morales has a socialist agenda, and as such his government is a close ally to the regimes of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Fidel Castro in Cuba."

The ""fire"" is actually a plasma discharge caused by the air ionizing at the end of a pointed object (like the mast of a ship), often observed during electrical storms."
ME_S,"MEGS.    	Disk drive capacity can be measured in ""megs"" (megabytes), although nowadays one tends to think in ""gigs"" (gigabytes)."
STAH_,"STAHL.    	Lesley Stahl has worked on ""60 Minutes"" since 1991. She is married to author ""Aaron Latham"". As a journalist Latham wrote the article that inspired the movie ""Urban Cowboy""."
HO_,"HOG.    	The Harley-Davidson motorcycle company was started up in the very early 1900s by two childhood friends, William Harley and Arthur Davidson, . Their first design was in effect an engine hooked up to a pedal bicycle, but the 116 cc cylinder capacity simply couldn't generate enough power to get up the hills of their native city of Milwaukee. The pair came up with a redesigned model that had a cylinder capacity of 405 cc, which the partners built in a shed at the back of Davidson's house. In 1906, the partners built their first factory, located where the company's headquarters is to this day, on Juneau Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin."

KLEE_EX,"KLEENEX.    	Even though Kleenex is sometimes used today as a generic term for a tissue, Kleenex is a brand name owned by Kimberley-Clark. Kleenex facial tissues came about after WW1. The material used in the tissue had been developed as a replacement for cotton that was in high demand as surgical tissue during the war. The material developed was called ""Cellucotton"" and was used in gas mask filters. It was first sold as a facial tissue under the name Kleenex in 1924."
_SYE,"AS YE.    	The commonly quoted line ""As ye sow, so shall ye reap"" is not actually a direct quote from the Bible, although the sentiment is expressed there at least twice.

DELIL_H,"DELILAH.    	Delilah is a Biblical figure, the wife of Samson. Delilah was engaged by the Philistines to betray her husband by determining the secret of his great strength. Samson lied to his wife three times, but on the fourth asking he told his wife the truth, that he did not cut his hair. Delilah then persuaded Samson to shear his locks and so allowed him to be captured by his enemies. Over the centuries, it has been usual to depict Delilah actually cutting off her husband's hair, but the Bible actually says that she persuaded Samson to do the job himself."

Q_II,"QE II.    	I watched the 2006 movie ""The Queen"" again a few weeks ago. What a great film it is, and what a superb performance from Helen Mirren in the title role of Queen Elizabeth II.
