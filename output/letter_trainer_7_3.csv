The courts gave him the option of the army or two years in prison. Hendrix chose the former, and soon found himself in the famous 101st Airborne.

TET_,"TETE.    	The French-Canadian children's song starts with, ""Alouette, gentille alouette ..."" ""Alouette"" is the French word for a bird, the ""lark"". The song is actually pretty gruesome, even though it was used to teach children the names of body parts.

Thor didn't qualify as an ICBM in that it's range was limited to 1,500 miles, and so was classified as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The Thor family of missiles was somewhat rushed into service as a stop-gap measure while ICBMs were being developed, for fear that the Soviets would get long range missile capability before the US. When ICBM missiles went into service, the Thor missiles were quickly retired, the last being withdrawn in 1963."
