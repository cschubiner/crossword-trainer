This adaptation makes it possible for them to live in conditions highly unsuitable for other fish that rely on their gills to get oxygen out of the water. Indeed, quite interesting ..."

RA_,"RAY.    	Ray Charles came up with his stage name by dropping the family name from his real moniker, Ray Charles Robinson. His life was a wild ride, well represented in the excellent biopic called 'Ray' released in 2004 and starring Jamie Foxx in the title role.

In the original fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, which dates back to 1836, the Little Mermaid is given no name at all, so ""Ariel"" is a creation by Disney. There is of course a famous statue of the unnamed Little Mermaid sitting in Copenhagen Harbor in Andersen's native Denmark, although the statue is currently ""on tour"".

G_R,"GAR.    	The fish known as a gar is very unusual in that it is often found in very brackish water. What is interesting about gar is that their swim bladders are vascularized so that they can actually function as lungs. Many species of gar can actually be seen coming to the surface and taking a gulp of air. This adaptation makes it possible for them to live in conditions highly unsuitable for other fish that rely on their gills to get oxygen out of the water. Indeed, quite interesting ..."

AV_C,"AVEC.    	I've always thought that the phrase ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?"" was grammatically ""odd"". The expression is sexually suggestive, meaning ""Would you like to sleep with me tonight?"" The problem is that the use of the formal (or plural!) ""vous"" instead of the familiar ""tu"" indicates a lack of intimacy that should be present in such a forward invitation. But, I just read that the term would perhaps be correct if the speaker was a high-class prostitute using formal grammar with a client."

Even though there is a Forest of Arden surrounding Shakespeare's home town of Stratford-on-Avon, seeing as the play is set in France one has to assume that the ""As You Like It"" Arden is an Anglicization of the forested ""Ardennes"" region that stretches from Belgium into France,and that famously featured in WWII's Battle of the Bulge."

By the end of the 18th century the word was being used by students at Cambridge University in England to refer to all local merchants and people of the town.

Nowadays a snob is anyone who looks down on those considered to be of inferior standing."

T_C,"TEC.    	'Tec' is a slang term for a private detective, a private investigator (PI)."
_AR,"BAR.    	Having lived on both sides of the Atlantic, I find the Mars Bar to be the most perplexing of candies! The original Mars Bar is a British confection (and delicious) first manufactured in 1932. The US version of the original Mars Bar is called a Milky Way. But there is candy bar called a Milky Way that is also produced in the UK, and it is completely different to its US cousin, being more like an American ""3 Musketeers"". And then there is an American confection called a Mars Bar, something different again. No wonder I gave up eating candy bars ..."

""Eres tu"" came second in the competition, but should have won in my humble opinion."

DD_,DDS.    	Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS)
CLAR_,"CLARA.    	If you ever get the chance to see it, I highly recommend the movie 1947 ""Song of Love"", a biopic about the lives of Robert Schumann and his extraordinary wife, Clara Wieck. Schumann is played by Paul Henreid (of ""Casablanca"" fame) and Clara is played wonderfully by Katherine Hepburn. Clara was an concert pianist, and as Katherine Hepburn was an accomplished pianist herself, you see Hepburn actually playing some challenging pieces herself at the keyboard (although the soundtrack does feature a professional player)."

It is used widely as a flavor enhancer, particularly in many Asian cuisines. Whether or not it is harmful seems to be still under debate.

A_PCA,"ASPCA.    	Unlike in most developed countries, there is no ""umbrella"" organization in the US with the goal of preventing cruelty to animals.

_RIEL,"ARIEL.    	William Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" tells the story of Prospero, who was removed from the throne of Milan and banished to a deserted island along with his daughter Miranda. Prospero learns sorcery while cast away, and eventually conjures up a tempest that drives those who usurped his throne onto the island's shores (in particular his own brother, Antonio). On the island, Prospero is eventually successful in revealing Antonio's lowly nature."
T_E,"TUE.    	Election Day was chosen by Congress back in 1845. The month of November was selected as it suited an agricultural society, following the fall harvest and yet not too far into winter, which could make travel difficult.

The electric eel has three pairs of organs along its abdomen, each capable of generating an electric discharge. The shock can go as high as 500 volts with 1 ampere of current (that's 500 watts), and that could perhaps kill a human."
_ODEO,RODEO.    	The phrase 'not my first rodeo' means 'not the first time I've done this'.

EE_,EES.    	Electrical engineer (EE) 
_EESE,"GEESE.    	Apparently geese fly in that V-formation for a couple of reasons. One is that it makes for efficient flight and conserves energy. The leading bird gets no advantage, but every following bird gets to ""slipstream"" a little. It has been noted that the lead bird drops to the back of the formation when he/she gets fatigued. It's also thought that the flock can stick together more easily when in formation, so it is more difficult to lose someone along the way."
TUT_,"TUTU.    	The word ""tutu"", used for a ballet dancer's skirt, is actually a somewhat ""naughty"" term. It came into English from French in the early 20th century. The French ""tutu"" is an alteration of the word ""cucu"", a childish word for ""cul"" meaning the ""bottom, backside""."

A_TS,ACTS.    	The Acts of the Apostles is the fifth book of the New Testament.
_AD,"DAD.    	Father's Day was added as an official holiday in 1972, although bills to create the holiday had been with Congress since 1913. By rights, the holiday should be called 'Fathers' Day' (note the punctuation), but the Bill that was introduced in 1913 used the 'Father's Day' spelling, and that's the one that has stuck."
AR_EL,"ARIEL.    	The Story Of Civilization' is an epic work by husband and wife team Will and Ariel Durant. The eleven-volume set of books tells at least part of the story of Western Civilization, in over 4 million words written on almost 10,000 pages.

He was marvelous in the ""Home Alone"" films, the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and my personal favorite, ""My Cousin Vinnie"". He gets a mention in the stage musical ""Jersey Boys"", which isn't too surprising as he is one of the show's producers."

The work was done under the auspices of the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Division, so ASD was combined with the IC from ""superson-ic-s"" to create the name ASDIC. The navy even went as far as renaming the quartz material at the heart of the technology ""ASDivite"".
