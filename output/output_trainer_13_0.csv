Although the technique was developed primarily for black & white film, it can even apply to digital color images. In the digital world, the main technique is to expose an image for the highlights, and one or more images for the shadows. These images can then be combined digitally giving a final image with a full and satisfying range of exposures."

My favorite is that ""hobo"" comes from the first letters in the words ""ho-meward bo-und"", but it doesn't seem very plausible.
