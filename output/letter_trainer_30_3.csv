MARSBA_S,"MARS BARS.    	Having lived on both sides of the Atlantic, I find the Mars Bar to be the most perplexing of candies! The original Mars Bar is a British confection (and delicious) first manufactured in 1932. The US version of the original Mars Bar is called a Milky Way. But there is candy bar called a Milky Way that is also produced in the UK, and it is completely different to its US cousin, being more like an American ""3 Musketeers"". And then there is an American confection called a Mars Bar, something different again. No wonder I gave up eating candy bars ..."
_ARNE,"CARNE.    	Carne: Spanish for ""meat""."
TANI_,"TANIA.    	Famously, Patty Hearst joined forces with her 1974 kidnappers, the Symbionese Liberation Army. At the same time she took on an assumed name, Tania.

President Clinton's last official act before leaving office was to grant Patty Hearst a pardon."

S_OAT,"SHOAT.    	""Shoat"" is a name given to a young hog, after it has been weaned."
B_NK,"BANK.    	A certificate of deposit is sort of like a less flexible, but higher paying, savings account. Instead of depositing into a savings account, and earning interest periodically, the amount depending on the balance at that time, one can open a CD. With a CD one deposits a minimum amount of money, and must leave it there for a specified length of time. In return one is given a higher interest rate than a savings account, and can redeem that interest and the initial deposit when the term has expired. CDs are relatively low risk investments as they are FDIC insured, just like savings accounts."
SON_Y,"SONNY.    	Sonny Corleone was oldest son of Don Vito Corleone in Mario Puzo's great novel, ""The Godfather"". In the movie he was played by James Caan.

IT_,"IT I.    	Perhaps the most famous rendition of the words ""Is it I"", comes from the Bible, Matthew 2:25. When Jesus is talking of his pending betrayal, Judas asks Him, ""Is it I?"""
O_ARKS,"OZARKS.    	The Ozark Mountains aren't really mountains geographically speaking, and the Ozarks are better described by the alternate name, the Ozark Plateau. It's not really certain how the Ozarks got their name, but my favorite theory is that ""Ozarks"" is the phonetic spelling of ""aux Arks"", short for ""of Arkansas"" in French."
W_ISS,"WEISS.    	The name ""Marat/Sade"" is a useful abbreviation for the real name of Peter Weiss's most famous play. It is actually called ""The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade"".

B_ANDO,"BRANDO.    	Marlon Brando won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Vito Corleone in the 1972 blockbuster ""The Godfather"". He turned down the award and didn't attend the ceremony. Instead he sent a Native American rights activist called Sacheen Littlefeather who made a speech protesting the depiction of Native Americans in Hollywood movies. Brando wasn't the first person to refuse an Oscar. George C. Scott did the same thing when he won for playing the title role in 1970's ""Patton"". Scott just didn't like the whole idea of ""competing"" with other actors."
EE_,"EEE.    	A roomy, wide, flat shoe might by a EEE."
J_ETORRE,"JOE TORRE.    	As a manager, Joe Torre was part of four World Series wins, all of them with the New York Yankees baseball team.

During the run up (pun intended!) to the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Torre carried the Olympic flame part of the way through Florence in Italy, handing it over to the next runner at the famous Ponte Vecchio.

BAN_S,BANGS.    	Mamie Eisenhower has to have been one of the most charming of all the First Ladies of the United States. Ms. Eisenhower suffered from an inner ear complaint called Ménière's disease which caused her to lose her balance quite often. Because she was unsteady on her feet there were unfounded rumors floating around Washington that Ms. Eisenhower had a drinking problem. People can be very unkind ...
A_EE,"A-DEE.    	'Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah' is a song from the Disney film 'Song of the South', released in 1946. The song won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1947."
GE_,GEM.    	A lot of people think that the Inspector Clouseau character (played originally by Peter Sellers) is 'The Pink Panther'. It's actually the jewel that was stolen in the original movie. Would you believe there are eleven 'Pink Panther' movies in the whole series?
TO_IC,"TONIC.    	The original tonic water was a fairly strong solution of the drug quinine dissolved in carbonated water. It was used in tropical areas in South Asia and Africa where malaria is rampant. The quinine has a prophylactic effect against the disease, and was formulated as ""tonic water"" so that it could be easily distributed. In British colonial India, the colonial types got into the habit of mixing in gin with the tonic water to make it more palatable, and hide the bitter taste of the quinine. Nowadays, the level of quinine in tonic water has been dropped, and sugar has been added."

TA_MAC,"TARMAC.    	The terms 'Tarmac' and 'macadam' are short for 'tarmacadam'. In the 1800s, Scotsman John Loudon McAdam developed a style of road known as 'macadam'. Macadam had a top-layer of crushed stone and gravel laid over larger stones. The macadam also had a convex cross-section so that water tended to drain to the sides. In 1901, a significant improvement was made by English engineer Edgar Purnell Hooley who introduced tar into the macadam, improving the resistance to water damage and practically eliminating dust. The 'tar-penetration macadam' is the basis of what we now call Tarmac."
M_G,MTG.    	39. See 37-Down : PDA
DAR_Y,"DARCY.    	Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy has to be one of the great romantic leads in English literature. He of course appears opposite Mis Elizabeth Bennet in Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". There have been many (terrible) ""sequels"" written for ""Pride and Prejudice"", but I have read one ""spin off"" that I heartily recommend if you'd like to explore the story of Elizabeth and Darcy some more. There is a three-part novel called ""Fitzwilliam Darcy: Gentleman"" written by Pamela Aiden and published in 2003-2005. Ms. Aiden does a great job retelling the story of ""Pride and Prejudice"", but from Darcy's perspective. It really is a great read, even for die-hard Austen fans ..."

EU_ER,EULER.    	'Euler' sounds like 'oiler'.
KL_ENEX,"KLEENEX.    	What a clever clue! Even though Kleenex is sometimes used today as a generic term for a tissue, Kleenex is a brand name owned by Kimberley-Clark. Kleenex facial tissues came about after WW1. The material used in the tissue had been developed as a replacement for cotton that was in high demand as surgical tissue during the war.

ASPHA_T,"ASPHALT.

DU_AI,"DUBAI.    	Burj Khalifa is a spectacular skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is the tallest man-made structure in the world, and has been so since the completion of its exterior in 2009.

The building was part of a US$20 billion development of downtown Dubai that was backed by the city government which had to go looking for a bailout from the neighboring city of Abu Dhabi.

JSBAC_,"JS BACH.    	Perhaps the most famous mass in classical music is J. S. Bach's ""Mass in B minor"", fittingly completed just before he died. It was one of the last of Bach's compositions, although much of the music was composed earlier in his life."
_LAGG,"FLAGG.    	Fannie Flagg is the stage name of American actress Patricia Neil. Neil had to change her name to avoid confusion with the famous Oscar-winning actress of the same name.

She also wrote the screenplay for the screen adaptation ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" which was released in 1991."

However, in the presence of the enzyme amylase (found in saliva, say) this production of sugar happens very, very quickly."
OLEANN_,"OLEANNA.    	I've never seen it, but ""Oleanna"" sounds like a powerful play to me. Written by David Mamet, it was first performed in 1992. It's a two-person piece, the tale of a university professor and a female student who accuses him of sexual exploitation. Mimet got many of the themes of the play from the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings in which Anita Hill accused the future Supreme Court justice of sexual harassment."
TWI_,"TWIN.    	According to tradition, Rome was founded by the twin brothers Romulus and Remus. The pair had a heated argument about who should be allowed to name the city and Romulus hit Remus with a shovel, killing him. And so, 'Rome' was born, perhaps instead of ""Reme""!"

_EASEL,WEASEL.    	To weasel out of something is to back away from a prior commitment. The association of 'weasels' with the concept of not being trusted might have arisen from the behavior in which a weasel sucks out the contents of an egg while leaving the shell virtually intact.

The initial intent was to offer tips to teenagers on manners and social graces, hence the name of the title character Etta Kett (sounds like 'etiquette')."
RAGLA_,"RAGLAN.    	Actually I think the Raglan title is Baron.

Rosin is formed into cakes that players of stringed instruments use to rub along the hairs of their bows to help improve sound quality.

_NDORA,"ENDORA.    	In the television sitcom ""Bewitched"", Endora was Samantha's mother, with both mother, daughter, and indeed granddaughter having the magical powers accorded to witches. Endora was played flamboyantly by Agnes Moorehead."

LAS_,"LAST.    	""In the cellar"" is a familiar phrase meaning ""in last place""."
_EES,"VEES.    	Apparently, geese fly in a V-formation for a couple of reasons. One is that it makes for efficient flight and conserves energy. The leading bird gets no advantage, but every following bird gets to ""slipstream"" a little. It has been noted that the lead bird drops to the back of the formation when he/she gets fatigued. It's also thought that the flock can stick together more easily when in formation, so it is more difficult to lose someone along the way."
A_FS,"ARFS.    	The schnauzer breed of dog originated in Germany in the 1600s. The name 'schnauzer' is a colloquial term meaning 'moustache', derived from the German for 'snout'. The name is apt, given the breed's distinctive snout."

STON_S,"STONES.    	Even though Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have been the driving force behind the Rolling Stones for decades, they didn't start the group. The band was the idea of guitarist and harmonica player, Brian Jones, and it was he who invited Richards and Jagger as well as Ian Stewart with Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts rounding out the original lineup of six musicians. Jones called the band ""Rollin' Stone"" back then in 1962, named for the song by Muddy Waters. Jones was the leader, manager and decision maker for the first few years, until songs written by Richards and Jaggers became hits, and he started to lose artistic control. In 1967, Jones was arrested for drug possession, and again in 1968. When his trouble with the law prevented him from getting a US work visa, Jones wasn't able to accompany the Stones on a 1969 US tour. That was the last straw, it seems, and Jones and the Stones parted company. Famously, one month later, Jones was found dead, at the bottom of his swimming pool."

GOA_,"GOAD.    	The verb 'edge' has been used to mean to incite, to urge on, from the 16th century. Somewhere along the way 'edge' was mistakenly replaced with 'egg', giving us our term 'to egg on' meaning 'to goad'."

Dr. Who is a time traveler from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in his famous TARDIS spacecraft, that outwardly looks llike a police call box from the 1950s. TARDIS is an acronym for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space. The doctor ""regenerates"" from time to time (pun intended!) so that a new actor fits seamlessaly into the storyline. We are just being introduced to a new doctor on BBC America this month."
_TYLE,"STYLE.    	Perm' is the name given to a permanent wave, a chemical or thermal treatment of hair to produce waves or curls. I don't worry about such things, as it's a number-one all over for me ..."

LATO_A,"LA TOYA.    	La Toya Jackson was very close to her brother Michael, both in age and temperament. It seems to me that La Toya's obsession with the plastic surgeon's knife was second only to that of her younger brother."
IMD_,"IMDB.    	The website called the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) was launched in 1990, and is now owned by Amazon.com. It's a great site for answering question one has about movies and actors."

PENNA_E,"PEN NAME.    	""Ask Ann Landers"" was an advice column written by Eppie Lederer from 1995 to 2002. Eppie was the twin sister to Pauline Phillips, the person behind ""Dear Abby"". Eppie took over the ""Ask Ann Landers"" column from Ruth Crowley who started it in 1943."
_UBE,"TUBE.    	The official name 'London Underground', used for the city's train-based mass transit system, is a little deceptive. In fact, over half of the network's track is 'over ground', with the underground sections reserved for the central areas. It is the oldest subway system in the world, opening in 1863. It was also the first system to use electric rolling stock, back in 1890. 'The Tube', as it is known by Londoners, isn't the longest subway system in the world though. That honor belongs to the Shanghai Metro. My personal favorite part of the Tube is the Tube map! It is a marvel of design ..."
L_ZA,"LIZA.    	The actress and singer Liza Minnelli is the daughter of Judy Garland and movie director Vincente Minnelli. Liza won her only Oscar for her lead performance in 1972's 'Cabaret'.

YA_,"YAK.    	The English word 'yak' is an Anglicized version of the Tibetan name for the male of the species. Yak milk is much prized in the Tibetan culture. It is made into cheese and butter, and the butter is used to make a tea that is consumed in great volume by Tibetans. The butter is also used as a fuel in lamps, and during festivals the butter is even sculpted into religious icons."
_OBERTA,"ROBERTA.    	I suppose the most famous song released by American singer Roberta Flack is her 1972 hit ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face""."

C_METS,"COMETS.    	The famed rock & roll singer and songwriter Bill Haley started out his career as the frontman of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen, playing country and western music. The name was changed to Bill Haley and His Comets in 1952 as the band started performing rock & roll songs. The name ""Comets"" was imitative of the common mispronunciation of the famous Halley's comet (sometimes written incorrectly as ""Haley's"" comet). The group recorded ""Rock Around the Clock"" a year later, in 1953."
AC_P,"A-COP.    	""Rent-a-cop"" is a derogatory term for a security guard."

S_IKE,"SPIKE.    	To lace a drink, is to spike it, by adding perhaps some alcohol or other strong substance."
YUL_S,"YULES.    	""Yule"" celebrations coincide with Christmas, and the words have become synonymous in much of the world. However, Yule was originally a pagan festival celebrated by Germanic peoples. The name ""yule"" comes from the Old Norse word ""jol"" that was used to describe the festival."
DOSI_O,"DO-SI-DO.    	The term do-si-do is actually a corruption of a French phrase ""dos-a-dos"", meaning back-to-back. And parenthetically, this is just the opposite to the familiar French term ""vis-a-vis"", meaning face-to-face. In the dance move, the partners start facing each other, then advance past each other's right shoulder, and then move to the right without turning so that they are now facing away from each other (back-to-back).

PAPAD_C,"PAPA DOC.    	The dictatorial President of Haiti known as ""Papa Doc"" was in fact a medical doctor. Francois Duvalier graduated with a medical degree from the University of Haiti in 1934, and even spent a year studying public health at the University of Michigan. It was his grateful patients who used to call him Papa Doc. When he came to power as President, he was less caring, and ruled with an iron fist until he died in office in 1971."
_ISK,"RISK.    	Risk is a fabulous board game, first sold in France in 1957. Risk was invented by a very successful French director of short films called Albert Lamorisse.

NI_OLE,"NICOLE.    	""The Simple Life"" is a reality TV show that ran from 2003 to 2007. It showed little rich girls Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie trying to do manual labor and working ""real"" jobs. I wonder how they'd do writing a crossword blog?"
BLO_,"BLOG.    	Many folks who visit this website regard it as just that, a website. That is true, but more correctly it is referred to as a blog, as I make regular posts (actually daily posts) which then occupy the ""front page"" of the site. The blog entries are in reverse chronological order, and one can just look back day-by-day, reading older and older posts. 'Blog' is a contraction of the term ""web log""."
BACAR_I,"BACARDI.    	The Bacardi company is still family owned and operated, based in Hamilton, Bermuda. The company was originally based in Santiago de Cuba, and became successful by selling a refined refined form of rum, something new to a market that was used to a crude, dark rum.

AREACO_ES,"AREA CODES.    	Area codes were introduced in the 1940s. Back then the 'clicks' one heard when dialling a number led to mechanical wear on various pieces of equipment.

That led to New York getting the area code 212, Los Angeles 213 and Chicago 313."

The man is a god in her eyes ..."

AP_S,APRS.    	Annual percentage rate (APR)
V_A,"VOA.    	The United States Information Agency (USIA) was established under President Eisenhower in 1953, and continued operating until 1999. It's mission was ""public diplomacy"", another term for propaganda broadcast over radio airwaves. The intent from day one was to avoid having the broadcasts identified as propaganda, and speaking as a former listener to the USIA's Voice of America (VOA) over in Europe, there were a lot of fun programs that had one coming back to hear more, but we all knew it was propaganda quite frankly ..."
SCI_NCE,"SCIENCE.    	Adam Smith was a pioneer in the field of 'political economy', an original term used for the study of production and trade and their relationship with law, government and the distribution of wealth. Adam Smith's great work is called 'The Wealth of Nations', published in 1776.

S_NE,"SANE.    	Even though the game of ""marbles"" has been around since the early 1700s, the use of marbles meaning ""one's faculties, common sense"", probably has nothing to do with the game. Rather, the French word ""meubles"" meaning furniture, was brought into English as ""marbles"" in the mid-1800s to mean ""personal effects, furniture"". It was ""marbles"" in this sense that evolved into ""having one marbles"", a slang term from the late twenties, meaning ""having one's faculties""."

ATR_P,"ATRIP.    	When many anchors are thrown overboard, they not only are attached to an anchor chain, but they also have a ""trip line"" that is attached to the head of the anchor. When the vessel pulls on the anchor chain, it cause the anchor to dig deeper into the bottom, so attempting to pull up the anchor just by the chain is often problematic. However, if one pulls on the trip line first, the anchor is pulled out of the seabed, and can then be lifted by winding in the anchor chain. After the trip line has been used, the anchor is off the bottom, and is said to be ""atrip""."

One of the main ways used to distinguish them is by their teeth and jaws. Both the upper and lower sets of teeth of a crocodile are visible when its mouth is closed, whereas only the upper teeth of an alligator are visible with the mouth shut."
C_JUN,"CAJUN.    	The great explorer Verrazzano gave the name ""Arcadia"" to the coastal land that stretched from north of present day Virginia right up the North American continent to Nova Scotia. The name Arcadia was chosen as it was also the name for a part of Greece that had been viewed as ""idyllic"" from the days of classical antiquity. The ""Arcadia"" name quickly evolved into the word ""Acadia"" that was used locally here in North America. Much of Acadia was settled by the French in the 1600s, and then in 1710 Acadia was conquered by the British. There followed the French and Indian War after which there was a mass migration of French Acadians, often via the French colony of Saint-Dominique (present-day Haiti) to the French colony of Louisiana.

PAR_A,"PARMA.    	Parma is a city in northern Italy, famous for its ham (prosciutto) and cheese (parmesan). Although the word prosciutto is used in Italian to mean ham however it is prepared, in English we use the word to describe the dry-cured ham that is served raw, in thin slices. Apparently, prosciutto can be made out of the meat from the leg of a pig, or from the thigh of a wild horse."

_HASAN,"LHASAN.    	Lhasa is the capital city of Tibet, and the name 'Lhasa' translates as 'place of the gods'. However, Lhasa used to be called Rasa, a name that translates into the less auspicious 'goat's place'. Lhasa was also once called the 'Forbidden City' due to its inaccessible location high in the Himalayas and a traditional hostility exhibited by residents to outsiders.

MA_OR,"MANOR.    	""Animal Farm"" is the 1945 novella written by George Orwell, a satire of life in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. Orwell had trouble getting his novel published in his homeland of the UK during WWII as anti-Soviet literature wasn't a good thing to publish while the UK and USSR were on the same side of a World War. In fact, one publisher who was willing to publish changed his mind after being warned off by the British Ministry of Information. I find it interesting that Orwell should write ""Nineteen Eight-Four"" a few years later, and introduce the world to Big Brother."
B_ES,"BEES.    	Back in 18th century America, when neighbors would gather to work together for the benefit of one of their group, such a meeting was called a ""bee"".

MA_N,"MAIN.    	When one thinks of the word 'main' in the context of the sea, the Spanish Main usually comes to mind.

A loop of string is placed on the board, with the nails in the middle. A pen is then placed inside the loop, and moved as far away from the nails as possible, confined by the string.
