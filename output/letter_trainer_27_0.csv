BRI_,"BRIC.    	Bric-a-brac was a French phrase that was used as far back as the 16th century, but is now obsolete. It was a nonsense term meaning ""at random"" or ""any old way"".

CAP_IS,"CAPRIS.    	Capri pants first became popular on the island of Capri, apparently. They were invented in Europe in 1948, but only became stylish in the US in the sixties. Mary Tyler Moore often wore Capri pants on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" and to some extent she sparked a fashion trend.

A_CAN,"ALCAN.    	The Alaska Highway is also known as the Alaska-Canadian Highway or ALCAN Highway. A highway connecting the contiguous United States to Alaska was proposed in the twenties, but the Canadian authorities didn't believe the project had much merit as the road would be used by very few of its citizens. The perceived importance of the route increased during WWII, and President Roosevelt deemed the road a strategic necessity so he made a deal with Canada. The cost of construction would be born by the US, but the road and related facilities were to be handed over to Canada at the end of the war. The project was accelerated when the Japanese invaded and occupied Kiska and Attu Islands in the Aleutians. The road of course has been improved and is still in use today, and forms part of what is popularly known as the Pan-American Highway, which runs from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska to the south of Argentina or Chile, depending on how the route is defined."
DEER_S,"DEERES.    	John Deere invented the first commercially successful steel plow in 1837. Prior to Deere's invention, farmers used an iron or wooden plow that constantly had to be cleaned as rich soil stuck to its surfaces. The cast-steel plow was revolutionary as its smooth sides solved the problem of 'stickiness'. The Deere company that John founded uses the slogan 'Nothing Runs Like a Deere', and has a leaping deer as its logo."
LE_N,"LEAN.    	The psychologist William Herbert Sheldon proposed a now-discredited theory that a person's intelligence, future achievement and temperament could be associated with particular body types. Sheldon proposed three 'somatotypes', a classification that is still used today:"

S_ERN,"STERN.    	Howard Stern is one of the original ""shock jocks"" who seems now to have found his niche on uncensored satellite radio (SiriusXM). Apparently Stern is quite the chess player, and was invited to play in the 2010 US Chess Championships, albeit as a wildcard choice."

Richard Roeper is columnist and film critic for ""The Chicago Sun-Times"", and came to national attentions when he replaced Gene Siskel as co-host with Roger Ebert on the famous film review TV show.

KENO_I,"KENOBI.    	Sir Alec Guinness has played many great roles over a long a distinguished career, but nowadays is best known (sadly, I think) for playing the original Obi-Wan Kenobi in ""Star Wars"". In the prequel ""Star Wars"" trilogy, the young Obi-Wan is played by another British (actually Scottish) actor, Ewan McGregor."
_LEOLE,"OLE OLE.    	""Ole Ole Ole!"" is chanted at soccer games by many Spanish speaking (or shouting) fans. I am very proud to claim that the fans of the Irish national team have adopted the chant as their own, and it can be heard practically non-stop when Ireland is playing (with some inventive melody behind it!)."
PUL_E,"PULSE.    	One's 'pulse' is the rhythmic throbbing of arteries that is usually detected at the wrist or the neck. The contraction of the heart creates a pressure wave in the blood that moves the arterial walls, which is detected as the pulse."

CL_Y,"CLAY.    	Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr. was born in 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky, changing his name to Muhammad Ali when he converted to Islam in 1964.

He had thrown the original into the Ohio River as a gesture of disgust after being refused service at a ""whites only"" restaurant."
M_TTE,"MATTE.    	Matte', meaning flat and lusterless, comes from the Old French word 'mat' meaning beaten down and withered. In turn, the French 'mat' comes from the Latin 'maddus', meaning 'maudlin with drink'. Sometimes I wonder about these derivations ..."

In the late sixties and early seventies, LaDonna Gaines (her real name) lived and worked in Germany. There she met and married an Austrian actor called Helmuth Sommer. They divorced not long after the marriage, but Donna kept his family name, just changing the ""o"" to ""u"" to give her the stage name of ""Donna Summer""."
STA_E,"STAGE.    	""As You Like It"" is one of Shakespeare's comedies, the tale of Rosalind fleeing from her Uncle's court, along with her cousin, Celia and the court jester, Touchstone. The play is perhaps most memorable for an oft-quoted monologue that starts with:"

S_LIT,"SPLIT.    	One might say ""oops"" at a bowling alley if one leaves two pins standing in a split."
GE_,"GEE.    	Conway Twitty was a country singer who crossed over to the rock and roll and pop genres. Twitty's real name was Harold Lloyd Jenkins, and he was named for the silent movie actor Harold Lloyd. There doesn't seem to be a definitive explanation for how Twitty chose his stage name, but one suggestion is that he combined the names of the cities of Conway, Arkansas and Twitty, Texas."
FRED_,"FREDO.    	Fredo Corleone is a middle son in the family, and was considered the weak member of the family, and was reduced to the role of ""gopher"".

_RY,"DRY.    	Zinfandel is my favorite red wine varietal. It amazes me that the rich and heavy red Zinfandel comes from the same grape as does the blush, White Zinfandel varietal."
_RANZ,"FRANZ.    	Franz Kafka was born in 1883 Prague, then part of Bohemia, today the capital of the Czech Republic. He is known today as one of the greatest novelists who worked in the German language, and even has an adjective named after him. Something that is ""kafkaesque"" is senseless, disorienting and may have menacing complexity. As it was for many great artists, Kafka's fame came after his death, when much of his work was published."
BONJOV_,"BON JOVI.    	Jon Bon Jovi was born John Francis Bongiovi, Jr., and he is the leader of the band that took his name, Bon Jovi."

AD_T,"ADIT.    	An adit is specific type of mine access, a horizontal shaft that extends into the mine. This can be compared with the more traditional vertical shaft that is used for access into most mines.

M_SALA,"MASALA.    	Chicken tikka masala is a dish, comprising chicken tikka (chunks of marinated chicken) served in a masala sauce. Masala is the Hindi word for ""mixture"", and describes a mixture of spices. A dish named ""masala"" uses the spices incorporated into a sauce that includes garlic, ginger, onions and chili paste. Although served as part of Indian cuisine, there seems to be a lot of evidence that chicken tikka masala was actually invented in an Indian restaurant in Britain."
A_DREI,"ANDREI.    	Andrei Sakharov was a Soviet nuclear physicist, and in his later life a human rights activist. He participated in the USSR's program to develop the country's first atomic bomb, and was an even more crucial contributor to the development of the devastating hydrogen bomb.

He was then moved from Moscow and put into internal exile in Gorky. It was only under Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership, that he was able to return home to Moscow."

Since 2005 there have been more than 100 million copies of the game installed on cell phones alone.
_ELDT,"VELDT.    	Also known as Veld, Veldt is the name given to large rural spaces in southern Africa. We might use the term ""boondocks"" for the same thing. The word comes from the German for ""field"". In Australia, the equivalent open spaces are called the Outback."
_RINS,"ERINS.    	Erin Moran is the lovely actress most famous for playing Joanie Cunningham on ""Happy Days"" and the resulting (short-lived) spin-off sitcom called ""Joanie Loves Chachi"".

ODE_TE,"ODETTE.    	Swan Lake' is such a delightfully light and enjoyable ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. 'Swan Lake' tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by a sorcerer. The ballet also features Odile, Odette's 'evil twin'. Odile is disguised to look like Odette with the goal of tricking the prince to fall in love with her. In the ballet, the roles of Odette and Odile are played by the same ballerina."

The mako gets its own back sometimes though, and attacks on humans are not unknown. And the shark in Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea"", that's a mako."
SAM_,"SAMI.    	Lapland is a geographic region in northern Scandinavia, largely found within the Arctic Circle. Parts of Lapland are in Norway, Sweden and Finland.

TREA_ON,"TREASON.    	Treason is a serious crime committed against the nation (or the sovereign). One who commits treason is termed a traitor. In the past, the term treason also applied to lesser crimes (like a woman killing her husband) so there was a differentiation between high treason against the king, and ""petit treason"", against a more common citizen."
L_TZ,"LUTZ.    	In figure skating, a Lutz is a toe-pick-assisted jump that one starts skating backwards and ends skating backwards (there's more to it that I don't really understand!). The maneuver is named after Alois Lutz, an Austrian skater who first performed it in competition way back in 1913. Lutz wowed the crowd with a single jump, and today both men and women are landing triple Lutz jumps. No one has landed a clean quadruple Lutz in competition."

UL_AR,"ULNAR.    	The ulnar nerve runs alongside the ulna (one of the bones in the lower arm). The ulnar nerve is the largest unprotected (not surrounded by muscle or bone) nerve in the human body. The nerve can be touched under the skin at the outside of the elbow. Striking the nerve at this point causes and an electric-type shock, known as hitting one's ""funny bone"" or 'crazy bone'."
NATALI_,"NATALIE.    	Natalie Cole is of course the daughter of Nat King Cole. Her mother was Maria Cole, a singer with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. The most famous version of the hit song ""Unforgettable"" was released in 1951 by Nat King Cole. In 1991, Natalie Cole recorded a version that was mixed with an earlier 1961 version sung by her father, creating an ""unforgettable"" father-daughter duet, 26 years after Nat King Cole had passed away."

He started acting in Vienna when he was quite young, only 17 years old. When Hitler came to power, the Jewish Lowenstein headed to Paris and then London, eventually ending up in Hollywood. Lorre found himself typecast as the wicked foreigner in American movies, but I think he sneered and snarled his way to the bank."
TO_,"TON.    	Here in the US, a ton is equivalent to 2,000 pounds. Over in the UK, a ton is 2,240 pounds. The UK unit is sometimes referred to as an Imperial ton or sometimes a 'long ton'.

Elian's mother drowned while trying to travel illegally to the US, while Elian and his mother's boyfriend survived the journey. The INS placed Elian in the care of paternal relatives in the US, who then petitioned to have the boy stay with them permanently, against the wishes of Elian's father back in Cuba. After court proceedings, the federal authorities forcibly removed Elian from his relatives in the US, and he was returned to his father who took him back to Cuba.

He was attending a performance of ""Aida"" in Rio de Janeiro as the assistant chorus master, on a night when a substitute conductor was leading the orchestra. The substitute was in charge because the lead conductor had been forced to step down by striking performers who would not work with him. The disgruntled lead conductor led the audience in booing the unfortunate substitute, forcing him off the stage. The another substitute attempted to lead the performance, but he could not overcome the hostility of the crowd. The musicians themselves begged Toscanini to take up the baton, for the first time in his life, simply because he knew the score by heart. After over an hour of mayhem, Toscanini led the company in a remarkable performance, to marvelous acclaim. His conducting career was launched."

The actual expression from the days of taking soundings with a lead weight on a line would have been ""by the deep six"" meaning that the depth was 6 fathoms, or 36 feet.

T_PEKA,"TOPEKA.    	Topeka is the capital of Kansas, and is located on the Kansas River in the northeast of the state. The name 'Topeka' was chosen in 1855 and translates from the Kansa and the Ioway languages as 'to dig good potatoes'.

DO_OS,"DODOS.    	The dodo was a direct relative of the pigeon and dove, although the fully-grown dodo was usually three feet tall. One of the reasons the dodo comes to mind when we think of extinction of a species, is that it disappeared not too long ago (last recorded alive in 1681) and humans were the reason for its demise. The dodo lived exclusively on the island of Mauritius and when man arrived, we cut back the forests that were its home. We also introduced domestic animals, such as dogs and pigs, that ransacked the dodo's nests. The dodo was deemed to be an awkward flightless bird and so the term 'dodo' has come to mean a dull-witted person."

There was an argument made that Tyler would continue as Vice-President but would assume the responsibilities of the office of President, in effect as 'Acting President'. However, Tyler proceeded as though he was taking over as President and took the oath of office in his hotel room in Washington. Soon afterwards, Congress declared that Tyler was indeed President, although many continued to dispute the fact. Many of President Tyler's opponents referred to him as 'His Accidency'. His term in office ended in 1845. When the Civil War began in 1861, Tyler sided with the Confederacy and was even elected to the Confederate House of Representatives for the 3rd District of Virginia.

Nowadays she carries some sway in the business world. Until 2007 she was on the compensation committee of Lehman Brothers, the band that approved all those big bonuses. She probably doesn't talk about that too much these days!"
MAR_O,"MARLO.    	I didn't watch the HBO series called ""The Wire"" when it first aired. We ending up buying all five series on DVD and we watched the whole thing a couple of years ago.

The substitute was in charge because the lead conductor had been forced to step down by striking performers who would not work with him. The disgruntled lead conductor led the audience in booing the unfortunate substitute, forcing him off the stage. Yet another substitute attempted to lead the performance, but he could not overcome the hostility of the crowd.

The loofah(also loofa, lufah and luffa, Arabic words) is a vine, with fruit that's very popular in Asia and Africa. If the fruit is allowed to mature, it can be processed to remove everything but the more rigid xylem structure (remember your high school botany class?) leaving a soft, sponge-like mass that is used as skin polisher."

LC_AIM,"L'CHAIM.    	""L'Chaim"" is a Hebrew toast meaning ""to life"", as ""chai"" is the Hebrew word for ""life""."
DOD_S,"DODOS.    	The dodo was a direct relative of the pigeon and dove, although the fully-grown dodo was usually three feet tall. One of the reasons the dodo comes to mind when we think of extinction of a species, is that it disappeared not too long ago (last recorded alive in 1681) and humans were the reason for its demise. The dodo lived exclusively on the island of Mauritius and when man arrived, we cut back the forests that were its home. We also introduced domestic animals, such as dogs and pigs, that ransacked the dodo's nests. The dodo was deemed to be an awkward flightless bird and so the term 'dodo' has come to mean a dull-witted person."

L_MET,"LUMET.    	The movie ""Network"" was released in 1976. It was directed by Sidney Lumet and stars Peter Finch in his final role, for which he won a posthumous Academy Award. That Oscar for Peter Finch was remarkable in that it was the time the Best Actor award had been won after the actor passed away, and it was the first time it had been won my an Australian."

Instead he sent a Native American rights activist called Sacheen Littlefeather who made a speech protesting the depiction of Native Americans in Hollywood movies. Brando wasn't the first person to refuse an Oscar. George C. Scott did the same thing when he won for playing the title role in 1970's ""Patton"". Scott just didn't like the whole idea of ""competing"" with other actors."

The INS placed Elian in the care of paternal relatives in the US who then petitioned to have the boy stay with them permanently, against the wishes of Elian's father back in Cuba. After court proceedings, the federal authorities forcibly removed Elian from his relatives in the US, and he was returned to his father who took him back to Cuba. Back in Cuba, Fidel Castro stepped in and befriended Elian, so he has influential sponsorship now in his homeland as a result of his ordeal. Elian is now attending a Cuban military school."

_AT,"EAT.    	Elizabeth Gilbert is a novelist best known for her 2006 memoir ""Eat, Pray, Love"", a huge best seller that has gotten a boost with the release of a screen adaptation in August, 2010. Julia Roberts stars, and I haven't seen it yet, but no doubt will do so."

He has lost popularity in Poland in recent years, but is a very popular booking on the international speaking circuit."

The drug had been re-discovered in Bayer's labs, and was named by the company's head of research 'heroin' from the German 'heroisch' meaning 'heroic, strong'.

SAVA_T,"SAVANT.    	The term ""idiot savant"" is French, and literally means ""learned idiot"" ... not very nice, huh? Nowadays we use the term savant syndrome to describe a very specific condition in which an individual displays extensive expertise on one area in contrast with overall behavioral limitations. I suppose the archetypal savant was played by Dustin Hoffman in the fictional movie, 1988's ""Rain Man"". It was a work of fiction, but the lead character was based on real-life savant Kin Peek."
_MBER,"AMBER.    	Amber's technical name is ""resinite"", reflecting its composition and formation.

AN_IO,"ANZIO.    	The WWII Battle of Anzio is famous for being one of the most terrible blunders in military history. Operation Shingle was a surprise amphibious landing at Anzio, 35 miles south of Rome, designed to outflank the Germans and press home an attack on the Italian capital. The element of surprise allowed a safe landing at Anzio, and the allies were able to drive jeeps right into the outskirts of Rome unchallenged. But that element of surprise was lost when Allied commander General John Lucas decided to delay the march on Rome until he had consolidated his position on the beaches, a position that was surrounded by high ground. The Germans used the delay to throw everything they had into the high ground and the allies were pinned down in a bloody battle. As a result, it took four months for the allies to fight their way inland."

Lichtenstein was famous for his 'cartoon-strip' paintings, especially works called 'Whaam!' and 'Drowning Girl'.

A_E,"ASE.    	Enzymes are basically catalysts, chemicals that act to increase the rate of a particular chemical reaction. So, for example, starches will break down into sugars over time, especially under the right conditions. However, in the presence of the enzyme amylase (found in saliva, say) this production of sugar happens very, very quickly."
STI_G,"STIEG.    	Stieg Larsson was a Swedish journalist and writer, and indeed one of his main characters in his Millennium series of novels is a journalist as well. The first two titles in the series are 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and 'The Girl Who Played with Fire'.

CAG_R,"CAGER.    	In the early days of basketball, when a ball went out of bounds possession was awarded to the player who first retrieved the ball. This led to mad scuffles off the court, often involving spectators.

It's because of these cages that basketball players are sometimes referred to today as ""cagers""."

For example, mourners might throw sprigs of rosemary into graves, symbolically remembering the dead. The character Ophelia in William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' utters the line 'There's rosemary, that's for remembrance'. The name of the herb comes from the Latin 'ros marinus' which means 'dew of the sea'. The idea is that rosemary can in fact grow in some arid locations with only the moisture that is carried by a sea breeze."
