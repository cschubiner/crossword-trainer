M_I,"MRI.    	A CT (or ""CAT"") scan produces (via computer manipulation) a three dimensional image of the inside of an object, usually the human body. It does so by taking a series of two dimensional x-ray images while rotating the camera around the patient. The issue with CT scans is that they use x-rays, and high doses of radiation can be harmful causing damage that is cumulative over time. An MRI on the other hand (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), uses powerful magnetic fields to generate its images so there is no exposure to ionizing radiation (such as X-rays). We used MRI equipment in our chemistry labs at school, way back in the days when the technology was still called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMRI). Apparently the marketing folks didn't like the term ""nuclear"" because of its association with atomic bombs, so now it's just called MRI."

D_S,"DES.    	The city of Des Moines, the capital of Iowa, takes its name from the Des Moines River. The river in turn takes its name from the French ""Riviere des Moines"", meaning ""River of the Monks"". It looks like there isn't any ""monkish"" connection to the city's name per se. ""Des Moines"" was just the name given to the river by French traders who corrupted ""Moingona"", the name of a group of Illinois who lived by the river. However, others do contend that the French Trappist monks, who lived fully 200 miles away from the river, somehow influenced the name."

The basic decision by the Supreme Court was that a woman's constitutional right to privacy applied to an abortion, but that this right had to be balanced with a state's interest in protecting an unborn child and a mother's health. The Court further defined that the state's interest became stronger with each trimester of a pregnancy. So, in the first trimester the woman's right to privacy outweighed any state interest. In the second trimester the state's interest in maternal health was deemed to be strong enough to allow state regulation of abortion for the sake of the mother. In the third trimester the viability of the fetus dictated that the state's interest in the unborn child came into play, so states could regulate or prohibit abortions, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger.

I didn't watch ""The Wire"" when it first aired but we ending up buying all five series on DVD and we watched the whole thing a couple of years ago. It's is a great drama series, and I thoroughly recommend it. Personally, I think that HBO produces some of the best dramas on American television."

The nose was moved to the horizontal position during flight to create the optimum aerodynamic shape thereby reducing drag. It was lowered during taxi, takeoff and landing, so that the pilot had better visibility. The need for the droop nose was driven largely by the delta-shaped wings. The delta wing necessitates a higher angle of attack at takeoff and landing than conventional wing designs, so the pilot needed the nose lowered so that he or she could see the ground."

MR_,"MRI.    	A CT (or ""CAT"") scan produces (via computer manipulation) a three dimensional image of the inside of an object, usually the human body. It does so by taking a series of two dimensional x-ray images while rotating the camera around the patient. The issue with CT scans is that they use x-rays, and high doses of radiation can be harmful causing damage that is cumulative over time. An MRI on the other hand (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) uses powerful magnetic fields to generate its images so there is no exposure to ionizing radiation (such as X-rays). We used MRI equipment in our chemistry labs at school, way back in the days when the technology was still called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMRI). Apparently the marketing folks didn't like the term ""nuclear"" because of its association with atomic bombs, so now it's just called MRI."

The name change for the cape didn't go down well in Florida though, as the headland had been called Cape Canaveral for over 400 years. So, the name was restored in 1973, and Cape Kennedy is no more."

The basic decision by the Supreme Court was that a woman's constitutional right to privacy applied to an abortion, but that this right had to be balanced with a state's interest in protecting an unborn child and a mother's health. The Court further defined that the state's interest became stronger with each trimester of a pregnancy. So, in the first trimester, the woman's right to privacy outweighed any state interest. In the second trimester, the state's interest in maternal health was deemed to be strong enough to allow state regulation of abortion for the sake of the mother. In the third trimester, the viability of the fetus dictated that the state's interest in the unborn child came into play, so states could regulate or prohibit abortions, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger.

_RI,"MRI.    	A CT (or ""CAT"") scan produces (via computer manipulation) a three dimensional image of the inside of an object, usually the human body. It does so by taking a series of two dimensional x-ray images while rotating the camera around the patient. The issue with CT Scans is that they use x-rays, and high doses of radiation can be harmful and that damage is cumulative over time. An MRI on the other hand (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) uses powerful magnetic fields to generate its images so there is no exposure to ionizing radiation (like X-rays). We used MRI equipment in our chemistry labs at school, way back in the days when the technology was still called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMRI). Apparently the marketing folks didn't like the term ""nuclear"" because of its association with atomic bombs, so it's now just called MRI."

There is a constant flow of tar that seeps up to the surface from underground, a phenomenon that has been around for tens of thousands of years. What is significant is that much of the seeping tar is covered by water. Over many, many centuries animals came to the water to drink and became trapped in the tar as they entered the water to drink. The tar then preserved the bones of the dead animal. Today a museum is located right by the Tar Pits, recovering bones and displaying specimens of the animals found there. It's well worth a visit if you are in town ..."

OA_U,"OAHU.    	O'ahu has been called ""The Gathering Place"", although the word ""O'ahu"" has no translation in Hawaiian. It seems that O'ahu is simply the name of the island.

An official who didn't like the name changed it to Enid Station, using a character from Alfred Lord Tennyson's ""Idylls of the King"". Maybe if he hadn't changed the name, the city of Enid would now be called Skeleton, Oklahoma! Enid has the nickname ""Queen Wheat City"" because is has a huge capacity for storing grain, the third largest grain storage capacity in the world."

OAH_,"OAHU.    	Hanauma Bay is located east of Honolulu on the coast of Oahu. In Hawaiian 'hana' means bay and 'uma' means curve, so the locals usually refer to the area as simply Hanauma, as the word 'Bay' is extraneous."
D_S,"DES.    	The French word 'des' translates as 'of the', or 'some'."
_PO,"IPO.    	An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the very first offer of stock for sale by a company on the open market. In other words, an IPO marks the first time that a company is traded on a public exchange. Companies have an IPO to raise capital to expand (usually)."
O_ERA,"OPERA.    	The first Grammy Awards Ceremony was held in 1959 and focused on recognizing outstanding achievement in the recording industry. The idea of a Grammy Award came up when recording executives were working on the Hollywood Walk of Fame project in the fifties. These executives concluded that there were many people in the recording industry deserving of accolades but who would probably never make it to the Walk of Fame. As a result, they founded the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. The Academy considered naming the award the 'Eddies' after Thomas Edison, but then opted for 'Grammy' after Edison's invention: the gramophone."
ENI_,"ENID.    	""Idylls of the King"" is a cycle of twelve poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, that retell the tale of King Arthur. The sixth of the twelve ""idylls"" is the story of Geraint and Enid."

O_IO,OHIO.    	Ohio (OH)
_RI,"MRI.    	A CT (or ""CAT"") scan produces (via computer manipulation) a three dimensional image of the inside of an object, usually the human body. It does so by taking a series of two dimensional x-ray images while rotating the camera around the patient. The issue with CT scans is that they use x-rays, and high doses of radiation can be harmful causing damage that is cumulative over time. An MRI on the other hand (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), uses powerful magnetic fields to generate its images so there is no exposure to ionizing radiation (such as X-rays). We used MRI equipment in our chemistry labs at school, way back in the days when the technology was still called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMRI). Apparently the marketing folks didn't like the term ""nuclear"" because of its association with atomic bombs, so now it's just called MRI."
ET_,ETS.    	Extraterrestrial (ET)
OPER_,"OPERA.    	The original soap operas were radio dramas back in the fifties. Given the structure of society back then, the daytime broadcasts were aimed at housewives working in the home.

In the plains the Otoe adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle dependent on the horse, with the American bison becoming central to their diet."
M_I,"MRI.    	MRI scans can be daunting for many people as they usually involve the patient lying inside a tube with the imaging magnet surrounding the body. Additionally, the scan can take up to 40 minutes in some cases. There are some open MRI scanners available that help prevent a feeling of claustrophobia. However, the image produced by open scanners are of lower quality as they operate at lower magnetic fields."

E_LA,"ELLA.    	Ella Fitzgerald, the ""First Lady of Song"", had a hard and tough upbringing. She was raised by her mother alone in Yonkers, New York. Her mother died while Ella was still a schoolgirl, and subsequently she became less interested in school. She fell in with a bad crowd, even working as a lookout for a bordello and a Mafia numbers runner. She ended up in reform school, from which she escaped, finding herself homeless and living on the streets for a while. Somehow she managed to get herself a spot singing in the Apollo Theater in Harlem. From there her career took off, and as they say, the rest is history."
S_T,"SST.    	The most famous supersonic transport (SST) is the retired Concorde.

EST_E,"ESTEE.    	Estée Lauder was quite the successful business woman, with a reputation as a great salesperson. She introduced her own line of fragrances starting in 1953, a bath oil called ""Youth Dew"". ""Youth Dew"" was marketed as a perfume, but it was added to bath water. All of a sudden women were pouring whole bottles of Ms. Lauder's ""perfume"" into their baths, while using only a drop or two of French perfumes behind their ears. That's quite a difference in sales volume ..."

_OE,"ROE.    	Roe v. Wade was decided in a US District Court in Texas in 1970, and reached the Supreme Court on appeal. The basic decision by the Supreme Court was that a woman's constitutional right to privacy applied to an abortion, but that this right had to be balanced with a state's interest in protecting an unborn child, and a mother's health. The Court further defined that the state's interest became stronger with each trimester of a pregnancy. So, in the first trimester, the woman's right to privacy outweighed any state interest. In the second trimester, the state's interest in maternal health was deemed to be strong enough to allow state regulation of abortion for the sake of the mother. In the third trimester, the viability of the fetus dictated that the state's interest in the unborn child came into play, so states could regulate or prohibit abortions, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger. I'm no lawyer, but that's my understanding of the initial Supreme Court decision ..."

I_ES,"IDES.    	Julius Caesar was assassinated on the 15th (the ides) of March, 44 BC. He was attacked by a group of sixty people in the Roman Senate, and was stabbed 23 times. The first to strike a blow was Servilius Casca, who attacked Caesar from behind and stabbed him in the neck. In Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar', Casca utters the words 'Speak, hands, for me!' just before making the fatal blow. The following line, uttered by Caesar, is more famous though: 'Et tu, Brute?'"
I_ES,"IDES.    	There were three important days in each month of the old Roman calendar. These days originally depended on the cycles of the moon but were eventually ""fixed"" by law. ""Kalendae"" were the first days of each month, originally the days of the new moon. ""Nonae"" were originally the days of the half moon. And ""idus"" (the ides) was originally the day of the full moon, eventually fixed at the 15th day of a month. Well, actually the ides were the 15th day of March, May, July and October. For all other months, the ides fell on the 13th. Go figure ..."

RE_,"RES.    	In the digital world, resolution of a display, television, image etc. is defined by the number of pixels that can be displayed in a standard area (say a square inch). The emphasis today is on producing larger area displays/televisions, i.e increasing the number of pixels simply by increasing the size of the screen. In the past couple of decades the emphasis was on adding more pixels within the same screen size to increase resolution. This would just be wasted effort these days as further increases in resolution cannot be perceived by the eye. Now that TVs are capable of displaying such high resolutions, broadcasters are responding by producing a video signal of higher resolution that they call high-definition television, HDTV."
NCA_,"NCAA.    	The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) dates back to the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. When his son broke his nose playing football at Harvard, President Roosevelt turned his attention to the number of serious injuries and even deaths occurring in college sports.
