ROS_,"ROSA.    	Santa Rosa is the largest city in California's Wine Country, and the county seat of Sonoma County.

Examples are the use of s over c in words like ""defense"" (In Ireland we have defence and defense depending on usage), -re became -er as in center instead of centre (reversing the influence of French), and he dropped one of the Ls in words like traveler (I learned ""traveller"").

_SH,"ASH.    	The flue in a chimney is a duct that conveys exhaust gases from a fire to the outdoors. An important feature of a flue is that it is adjustable. When starting a fire, the flue should be wide open, maximizing airflow to get help ignition. When the fire is burning, flow through the flue should be more restricted. The flue needs to be open sufficiently to allow smoke and exhaust gases exit, but not too wide so that too much hot air escapes, dragging cold air into the house from elsewhere."

HER_,"HERA.    	According to Greek mythology, the goddess Eris tossed the Golden Apple of Discord into the middle of the table during the feast of the gods at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.

NEH_,"NEHI.    	The brand of Nehi cola has a name that sounds like 'knee-high', a measure of a small stature. Back in the mid-1900's, the Chero-Cola company that owned the brand went for a slightly different twist on ""knee-high"" in advertising.

THO_,"THOR.    	The 2011 movie 'Thor' is yet another film based on a comic book hero. Even though I won't be seeing it (I don't do comics), I must admit it does have an impressive cast.

The super-ego almost has a parental role, contradicting the id by introducing critical thinking and morals to behavioral choices."

TH_R,"THOR.    	Thor was the name of the first ballistic missile to go into operation for the US military (actually operated by the US Air Force). Thor didn't qualify as an ICBM in that it's range was limited to 1,500 miles, and so was classified as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The Thor family of missiles was somewhat rushed into service as a stop-gap measure while ICBMs were being developed, for fear that the Soviets would get long range missile capability before the US.

It was also as a bouncer that he adopted the name Mr. T. His catchphrase comes from the movie ""Rocky III"". Before he goes up against Rocky Balboa, Mr. T says, ""No, I don't hate Balboa, but I pity the fool"". He parlayed the line into quite a bit of success.

_YS,"SYS.    	The Social Security Administration (SSA) was of course set up as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. The first person to receive a monthly retirement benefit was Ida May Fuller of Vermont who received her first check for the sum of $22.54 after having contributed for three years through payroll taxes.
