When a moth finds a brighter light source, like an artificial light, it gets confused."

Rowling, the author of the books, on the radio the other day and she tells us that 'Voldemort' is supposed to be pronounced with a silent 't' on the end, so it sounds kind of French.

U_URA,"UHURA.    	Lt. Nyota Uhura was the communications officer in the original ""Star Trek"" television series, played by Nichelle Nichols. The role was significant in that it was one of the first African American characters to figure front and center in US television. In a 1968 episode, Kirk (played by William Shatner) and Uhura kiss, the first inter-racial kiss to be broadcast in the US. Apparently the scene was meant to be shot twice, with and without the kiss, so that network executives could later decide which version to air.

I_K,"INK.    	Quills have been used as writing implements since the 6th century. Historically, goose, swan and turkey feathers have been the quills of choice. A bird's feather is well suited for writing, as the hollow shaft acts as a reservoir for ink which then flows to the tip due to capillary action. Choice of feather is important. Right-handed writers are best served by feathers from the left wing, as the feather curves away from the palm of the hand when writing. The tip of the quill is sharpened using a ""quill knife"".

We civilians, all round the world, owe a lot to President Ronald Reagan because he directed the military to make GPS available to the public for the common good.

DA_E,"DAME.    	The American slang 'broad' is a rather offensive term for 'woman'. It is possible that 'broad' comes from the noun 'abroadwife', once used for a woman, often a slave woman, who was living away from her husband.

DR_NO,"DRANO.    	To clean out drains we might buy Crystal Drano which is sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely-divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that that mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."

Apparently the scene was meant to be shot twice, with and without the kiss, so that network executives could later decide which version to air.

The institute gave an $8million grant to set up the Children's Television Workshop with the task of creating an educational TV program for young people.

MOT_,"MOTH.    	The larvae of several types of moth are noted for eating fabrics made from natural fibers such as wool or cotton. Many people store woolens in cedar chests believing that the scent of the wood prevents a moth infestation.

One way to kill moth larvae in fabric is to freeze the garment for several days at a temperature below 8 degrees centigrade."

_LES,"OLES.    	Flamenco is a style of Spanish music and dance. The origin of the word ""flamenco"" isn't clearly understood, but the explanation that seems most credible to me is that it comes from Flanders in Northern Europe. Given that ""flamenco"" is the Spanish word for ""Flemish"" and Flanders is home to the Flemish people it makes perfect sense, doesn't it?"

M_TH,"MOTH.    	It isn't really understood why moths are attracted to artificial lights. There is one theory that sounds plausible to me though.

When a moth finds a brighter light source, like an artificial light, it gets confused."

ANA_,"ANAS.    	Santa Ana is the county seat of Orange County, California and takes its name from the Santa Ana River that runs through the city. The Santa Ana winds are the very dry air currents that sweep offshore late in the year in Southern California. Because these air currents are so dry, they are noted for their influence over forest fires in the area, especially in the heat of the fall. The winds arise from a buildup of air pressure in the Great Basin that lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Under the right conditions, that air spills over the peaks of the Sierra Nevada and basically ""falls"" down the side of the Sierra range, heading for the ocean. As the air falls it becomes drier and heats up, so that relative humidity can fall to below 10% by the time it hits the coast."
AN_SY,"ANTSY.    	The word ""antsy"" embodies the concept of ""having ants in one's pants"", meaning being nervous and fidgety. However, ""antsy"" has been used in English since the 1830s, whereas ""ants in the pants"" originated a century later."

PA_ST,"PABST.    	Pabst Blue Ribbon is the most recognizable brand of beer from the Pabst Brewing Company. There appears to be some dispute over whether or not Pabst beer ever won a ""blue ribbon"" prize, but the company claims that it did so at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The beer was originally called Pabst Best Select, and then just Pabst Select. With the renaming to Blue Ribbon, the beer was sold with an actual blue ribbon tied around the neck of the bottle until it was dropped in 1916 and incorporated into the label."
RO_,"ROT.    	""Balderdash"" means 'senseless jumble of words'. The original balderdash (back before the late 1600s) was a jumbled mix of liquids, like maybe beer and wine, or even beer and milk!"

He directed such classics as 'It Happened One Night', 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', 'Lost Horizon', 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', 'Meet John Doe', 'Arsenic and Old Lace' and the holiday favorite 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Capra was the first person to win three directorial Oscars: for 'It Happened One Night', 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town' and 'You Can't Take It With You'. Capra also did his bit during WWII, enlisting just a few days after Pearl Harbor was attacked. Given his great talent, and the fact that he enlisted at the relatively advanced age of 44, the US Army put him to work directing 11 documentary war films in the 'Why We Fight' series, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal."
IP_DS,"IPODS.    	I just read an article on hearing loss that cites a study published in the 'Journal of Pediatrics'. According to the study, 12&#189;% of kids between 6 and 19 suffer from a loss of hearing that is directly attributable to the use of earphones set at a dangerously high volume. Personally, I love listening to all sorts of programming using earbuds. I am careful to use 'in-ear' types of earphones that are designed to block out external noise so that I can listen to programming at the lowest possible volume, and don't have to drown out external sounds. My doctor gives me a pat on the back for doing so, and has asked me to spread the word!"

The inaugural event was held in 1814, but not at the White House, where it is held today. That first Egg Roll was held on the grounds of the US Capitol. After a new lawn was planted in 1877, Congress passed a law making it illegal to use the lawn as a children's playground (boo! hiss!), and so President Rutherford and his wife Lucy brought the Egg Roll to the White House (hurrah!)."
AN_S,ANOS.    	May (mayo) is one of the months in the Spanish year (año).
M_TA,"META.    	In recent decades the prefix 'meta-' has started to be used as a standalone adjective. In this sense 'meta' means 'self-referential', describing something that refers to itself.

A movie that is about the making of the very same movie could also be described as meta."

I liked her in the 2000 film ""Charlie's Angels"" but as I am no fan of Quentin Tarantino, I did not enjoy the movie ""Kill Bill"".

That made Nancy Pelosi the highest-ranking female politician in US history."
W_S,"WIS.    	Wisconsin is named for the Wisconsin River, the longest river in the state. The famous missionary Father Jacques Marquette recorded the Algonquian name for the river as 'Meskousing'. This was modified by French explorers to 'Ouisconsin', with the first syllable pronounced just like the French word for 'yes' &#8230; 'oui&#8217;. In the early 1800s this was anglicized to 'Wisconsin'."

Ebsen had been cast in the role of the Tin Man in the 1939 movie 'The Wizard of Oz', but he developed an allergy to the aluminium dust that was used in the makeup. He ended up in hospital and had to walk away from the part. Ebsen blamed 'The Wizard of Oz' on persistent problems that he had with his lungs in subsequent years. But Ebsen lived 16 years longer that any of the other major cast members of the film, so maybe he got the last laugh!"

LE_,"LET.    	The game of badminton was developed in the mid-1700s by British military officers in India. There was already an old game called battledore and shuttlecock, so the creation of badminton was essentially the addition of a net and boundary lines for play. The game was launched officially as a sport in 1873 at Badminton House in Gloucestershire in England, giving it the name that we now use."
OB_RON,"OBERON.    	Oberon and Titania are the King and Queen of the fairies in Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream""."
RO_,"ROT.    	The word ""bunk"" is short for ""bunkum"", the phonetic spelling of 'Buncombe', which is a county in North Carolina. Supposedly, a state representative made a dull and irrelevant speech that was directed to his home county of Buncombe, bringing the term ""bunkum"" into the language with the meaning of ""nonsense"". The derivative word ""debunk"" first appeared in a novel by William Woodward in 1923, when he used it to describe ""taking the bunk out of things""."
ME_A,"META.    	In recent decades the prefix 'meta-' has started to be used as a standalone adjective. In this sense 'meta' means 'self-referential', describing something that refers to itself. For example, 'This sentence starts with the word 'this' and ends with the word 'this'' might be called a meta sentence. A movie that is about the making of a movie could also be described as meta. For example, 'The Blair Witch Project' might be described as meta, which is a movie about some young people making a scary movie about the Blair Witch."
TKO_,"TKOS.    	In boxing, a knockout (KO) is when one of the fighters can't get up from the canvas within a specified time, usually 10 seconds. This can be due to fatigue, injury, or the participant may be truly ""knocked out"".

In this case the bout is said to end with a technical knockout (TKO)."

AN_I,"ANNI.    	""Annus"" (plural ""anni"") is the Latin for year."
BY_E,"BYTE.    	In the world of computers, a ""bit"" is the basic unit of information. It has a value of 0 or 1. A ""byte"" is a small collection of bits (usually 8), the number of bits needed to uniquely identify a character of text. The prefix mega- stands for 10 to the power of 6, so a megabyte (meg) is 1,000,000 bytes. And the prefix giga- means 10 to the power of 9, so a gigabyte (gig) is 1,000,000,000 bytes. Well, those are the SI definitions of megabyte and kilobyte. The purists still use 2 to the power of 20 for a megabyte (i.e. 1,048,576), and 2 to the power of 30 for a gigabyte."
_ED,"JED.    	In the excellent television show 'The West Wing', President Jed Bartlet is played by Martin Sheen. Leo McGarry was played very ably by John Spencer. If you haven't seen them, the early seasons of ""The West Wing"" are just fabulous. I learned so much about the workings of the American government through this TV show."
I_K,INK.    	(43. See 38-Across : SAC)

CT_,CTA.    	Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)
E_E,"ESE.    	O'ahu has been called ""The Gathering Place"", although the word ""O'ahu"" has no translation in Hawaiian. It seems that O'ahu is simply the name of the island. One story is that it is named after the son of the Polynesian navigator that first found the islands. The island is made up of two volcanoes, Wai'anae and Ko'olau, joined together by a broad valley, the O'ahu Plain."
KE_T,"KENT.    	Kent State University's main campus is located in Kent, Ohio. Kent State will forever be associated with student activism and opposition to the Vietnam War in the late sixties and early seventies. The fateful day was May 4, 1970 when members of the Ohio National Guard opened fire on students, killing four protesters and wounding nine."

T_RERO,"TORERO.    	'Matador' is a Spanish word used in English for a bullfighter, although the term isn't used in the same way in Spanish. The equivalent in Spanish is ""torero"". ""Matador"" translates aptly enough as 'killer'."
INDI_,"INDIA.    	Pachisi is an ancient Indian game that has been commercialized in the West as Ludo, Sorry! and Parcheesi. The name derives from the Hindi 'pachis' meaning 'twenty-five', which is the largest score that can thrown in one move in the original game."
TONT_,"TONTO.    	On the television version of 'The Lone Ranger', Tonto was played by the actor Jay Silverheels. Famously, the Lone Ranger's horse was called Silver and Tonto's mount was named Scout. But in the early shows, Tonto rode a horse called White Feller."

ORI_AMI,ORIGAMI.    	The Japanese word 'origami' is derived from ori (folding) and kami (paper).
DR_NO,"DRANO.    	To clean out drains we might buy Crystal Drano which is sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely-divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that that mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."
D_ANO,"DRANO.    	To clean out drains we might buy Crystal Drano which is sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely-divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that that mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."
OB_ES,"OBOES.    	The oboe is perhaps my favorite of the reed instruments. The name ""oboe"" comes from the French ""hautbois"" which means ""high wood"". When you hear an orchestra tuning before a performance you'll note (pun intended!) that the oboe starts off the process by playing an ""A"". The rest of the musicians in turn tune to that oboe's ""A""."
EE_Y,"EENY.    	Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,"
_UI,"DUI.    	In some states, there is no longer a legal difference between a DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) and a DUI (Driving Under the Influence). Other states retain that difference, so that by definition a DUI is a lesser offence than a DWI."
ALEU_,"ALEUT.    	The Aleuts live on the Aleutian Islands of the North Pacific, and on the Commander Islands at the western end of the same island chain. The Aleutian Islands are part of the United States, and the Commander Islands are in Russia."
P_OH,"POOH.    	Alan Alexander (A.A.) Milne was an English author, best known for his delightful ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" series of books. He had only one son, Christopher Robin Milne, born in 1920. The young Milne was the inspiration for the Christopher Robin character in the Winnie-the-Pooh stories. Winnie-the-Pooh was named after Christopher Robin's real teddy bear, one he called Winnie, who in turn was named after a Canadian black bear called Winnie that the Milnes would visit in London Zoo. The original Winnie teddy bear is on display at the main branch of the New York Public Library in New York."

_VITA,"EVITA.    	""Evita"" was the follow up musical to ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" for Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. Both of these works were originally released as album musicals, and very successful ones at that (I remember buying them when they first came out). 'Evita' was made into a film in 1996, with Madonna playing the title role and Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce playing her husband Juan Perón."

_TUD,"STUD.    	Stud poker is the name given to many variants of the game, all characterized by the dealer giving each player a mix of cards face-down and face-up. The cards facing downwards are called ""hole cards"", cards only visible to the individual who holds that particular hand. That gives rise to the phrase ""ace in the hole"", a valuable holding that only the player with the ace is aware of."
AK_ON,"AKRON.    	For part of the 1800s, the Ohio city of Akron was the fasting growing city in the country, feeding off the industrial boom of that era. The city was founded in 1825 and its location, along the Ohio and Erie canal connecting Lake Erie with the Ohio River, helped to fuel Akron's growth. Akron sits at the highest point of the canal and the name ""Akron"" comes from the Greek word meaning ""summit"". Indeed, Akron is the county seat of Summit County."

_AROL,"CAROL.    	'God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen' is a favorite Christmas carol of mine. Note the correct punctuation. For years I thought the first line was 'God rest you, merry gentlemen'. In fact, the verb 'rest' here means 'keep, continue to remain'. Rewriting the line in contemporary English might be 'May God keep you happy, gentlemen'."

EG_S,"EGGS.    	You can't get a Belgian waffle in Belgium, and the nearest thing is probably a Brussels waffle. Brussels waffles were introduced to the world in 1958, and arrived in the US in 1962 at the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle. The name 'Brussels' was changed to 'Bel-Gem' for the US market, which evolved into 'Belgian'."
TUB_,"TUBA.    	The tuba is the lowest pitched of all the brass instruments, and one of the most recent additions to the modern symphony orchestra (usually there is just one tuba included in an orchestral line-up). ""Tuba"" is the Latin word for ""trumpet, horn""."

CAP_A,"CAPRA.    	I can't tell you how many of Frank Capra's movies are on my list of all-time favorites. He directed such classics as 'It Happened One Night', 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', 'Lost Horizon', 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', 'Meet John Doe', 'Arsenic and Old Lace' and the holiday favorite 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Capra also did his bit during WWII, enlisting just a few days after Pearl Harbor was attacked. Given his great talent, and the fact that he enlisted at the relatively advanced age of 44, the US Army put him to work directing 11 documentary war films in the 'Why We Fight' series, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal."
_AP,"NAP.    	Back in the early 1800s, folks took 'nine winks' when getting a few minutes of sleep during the day. Dr. William Kitchiner extended this concept in his 1821 self-help book 'The Art of Invigorating and Prolonging Life'. He suggested 'A Forty Winks Nap', which we seem to have been taking ever since. Mind you, I'm up to about eighty winks most days ..."
R_T,"ROT.    	Blarney is a town in County Cork in the south of Ireland. Blarney is home to Blarney Castle, and inside the castle is the legendary Blarney Stone. ""Kissing the Blarney Stone"" is a ritual engaged in by oh so many tourists (indeed, I've done it myself!), but it's not a simple process. The stone is embedded in the wall of the castle, and in order to kiss it you have to sit on the edge of the parapet and lean way backwards so that your head is some two feet below your body. There is a staff member there to help you and make sure you don't fall. The Blarney Stone has been labelled as the world's most unhygienic tourist attraction! But once you've kissed it, supposedly you are endowed with the ""gift of the gab"", the ability to talk eloquently and perhaps deceptively without offending. The term 'blarney' has come to mean flattering and deceptive talk."
_LES,"OLES.    	'Matador' is a Spanish word used in English for a bullfighter, although the term isn't used in the same way in Spanish. The equivalent in Spanish is ""torero"". ""Matador"" translates aptly enough as 'killer'."

They were written by a number of ghost writers after the character was introduced by Edward Stratemeyer in 1930. Nancy's Aunt Eloise was often the source of the mysteries that were to be solved, as Nancy was often summoned to Eloise's New York City apartment to help unravel some case or other."

EC_O,"ECHO.    	In Greek mythology, Echo is one of the Oreads, the mountain nymphs. She fell in love with the vain Narcissus, and followed him into the forest one day.

_IOLA,"VIOLA.    	A contrabass is a very low-pitched musical instrument, the most common example of which is the double bass.

TO_T,"TORT.    	The word ""tort"" comes to us directly from the French word, meaning ""mischief, injury or wrong"". It's a fitting word, as tort law is generally about negligence, when the action of one party causes injury to another, in an action that is outside of the scope of criminal law."
