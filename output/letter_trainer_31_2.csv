If you're interested, Amazon are pushing them right now, and they even have a version that is selling for $139 with free shipping. I am sorely tempted ..."

Enron paid $100 million to get its name on the field, and then when the world found out what a scam Enron actually was, the Astros bought back the contract for the name, for a mere $2.1 million. The stadium became Astros Field for a few months, until the Coke people paid $170 million for a 28-year contract to christen the stadium Minute Maid Park. A good deal for the Astros, I'd say ..."

The SEALs were born out of the Navy's special warfare groups from WWII, like the Underwater Demolition Teams and the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons.

PON_I,"PONZI.    	Charles Ponzi was born in Luigi, Italy in 1882 and arrived in the US in 1903, flat broke having gambled away all his money on the voyage to Boston. Ponzi devised a scheme to buy what were known as ""international reply coupons"" through friends in Italy, which he had sent to him in the US so that he could redeem them on this side of the Atlantic. As the value in the US was greater than that in Italy, he could make a handsome profit. This was in itself an ""illegal"" transaction, buying an asset in one market at a low price, then immediately selling it in another market at a higher price. But it's what he did next that became known as a Ponzi Scheme. He couldn't redeem his coupons quickly enough due to red tape so he approached other investors, initially friends, and had them give him cash so that he could buy more coupons in Italy. He promised the investors he would double their money, which they did initially. Many people wanted to get in on the scheme seeing that Ponzi was able to make the new investors a profit and double the money of the original investors. Eventually, somebody did the math and word started to get out that the investment was risky, so the number of new investors started to fall. Without sufficient new investors Ponzi couldn't double the money of his latest investors, and the whole scheme unraveled."

_LOOF,"ALOOF.    	I suppose one might guess from the 'feel' of the word 'aloof' that is has nautical roots. Originally aloof meant 'to windward' and was the opposite to 'alee'. A helmsman might be instructed to stay aloof, to steer the boat into the weather to keep a distance from a lee-shore. It is from this sense of maintaining a distance that aloof came to mean 'distant' in terms of personality. Interesting, huh ...?"
FRO_,FROS.    	The Afro hairstyle might be referred to as a 'fro.
GA_S,"GARS.    	The fish known as a gar is very unusual in that it is often found in very brackish water. What is interesting about gar is that their swim bladders are vascularized so that they can actually function as lungs. Many species of gar can be seen coming to the surface and taking a gulp of air. This adaptation makes it possible for them to live in conditions highly unsuitable for other fish that rely on their gills to get oxygen out of the water. Indeed, quite interesting ..."

APPLEPI_,"APPLE PIE.    	The full expression is ""as American as motherhood and apple pie"". I think the concept here is not that America is the home of motherhood nor apple pie, but rather that America is as wholesome as motherhood and apple pie. I've heard that the phrase originated in WWII when GI's bring interviewed by journalists would say that they were going to war ""for Mom and apple pie""."
_ITS,"AITS.    	Aits are little islands found in a river. Aits aren't formed by erosion, but by the deposition of silt over time. As a result, aits often have a long and narrow shape running parallel to the banks as the sediment builds up with the flow of the water.

M_ES,"MAES.    	Mae West was always pushing the envelope when it came to the ""sexy"" side of show business, even in her early days in Vaudeville. One of the first plays in which she starred on Broadway was called ""Sex"", something she penned herself. The show was a sell-out, but city officials had it raided and West found herself spending ten days in jail after being convicted of ""corrupting the morals of youth"". She started in movies in 1932, already 38 years old. West used her experience writing plays to rewrite much of the material she was given, and so really she was totally responsible for her own success and on-screen appeal."

He landed on Kauai, and named the whole archipelago the Sandwich Islands, in honor of the fourth Earl of Sandwich who was in charge of the British Admiralty at the time. Cook continued his voyage, leaving Hawaii to explore the coast of what is now called Canada and Alaska, and returning to Hawaii the following year. After one month of contact with the native Hawaiians, Cook departed from the islands but was forced to return to repair a broken mast. Relations between the Europeans and the islanders had been good but despite this a dispute developed and got out of control that resulted in Cook being struck on the head and stabbed to death. His body was dragged away by the islanders, and as an apparent sign of respect for the Captain, the natives processed his body according to funeral traditions associated with Hawaiian kings and elders. Eventually, after a petition from the remaining crew, some of Cook's remains were also returned for a formal burial at sea, adhering to British naval tradition. "

The ocarina was brought to Italy in the 1800s where it became popular as a child's toy, but also as a serious instrument.

Two distinguishing features are the impressive wireless remote control and its WiiConnect24 system which allows the console get messages and updates wirelessly in standby mode.

_SIMOV,"ASIMOV.    	Isaac Asimov was a wonderful science fiction writer, and a professor of biochemistry. He was a favorite author as I was growing up and I must admit that some hero worship on my part led me to study and work as a biochemist for a short while early in my career. My favorite of his works is the collection of short stories called 'I, Robot', although Asimov's most famous work is probably his 'Foundation' trilogy of novels."

As he was leaving on an 1831 voyage aboard the brig Charles Doggett, he unfurled the American flag that he had just been given by a group of friends.

By the way, on that same voyage, Charles Doggett rescued the famous mutineers of the HMS Bounty, when he found them on Pitcairn Island."
CAF_E,"CAFFE.    	The term 'latte' is an abbreviation of the Italian ""caffelatte"" meaning ""coffee (and) milk"". Note that in the correct spelling of ""latte"", the Italian word for milk, there is no accent over the ""e"". An accent is often added by mistake when we use the word in English, perhaps meaning to suggest that the word is French in origin."
TAR_AR,"TARTAR.    	Calculus or tartar is dental plaque that has hardened on the surface of teeth. Plaque is removed relatively easily by brushing and flossing. Once plaque has hardened into tartar though, a dental hygienist usually needs to intervene."

RB_,"RBS.    	We never used the word ""gridiron"" when I was growing up (meaning a grill used for cooking food over an open fire). So, maybe I am excused for finding out fairly recently that a football field gridiron is so called because the layout of yard lines over the field looks like a gridiron used in cooking!"
DRAC_,"DRACO.    	Ursa Minor sits right beside the constellation Draco (Latin for ""dragon""). Once Ursa Minor was considered to be the wing of Draco, and so was called ""Dragon's Wing""."
_RIANE,"ARIANE.    	""Ariane"" was not the most successful work by Jules Massenet, that's for sure. ""Ariane"" has rarely been performed since its opening in 1906 in Paris. A few years after the debut of ""Ariane"", Massenet introduced most of the same characters in another opera named ""Bacchus"". ""Bacchus"" doesn't get performed much either ..."

BEAST_E,"BEASTIE.    	The famous Robert Burns poem, ""To a Mouse"" describes the little creature as a ""wee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie"".

HOBO_,"HOBOS.    	No one seems to know for sure how the term ""hobo"" originated, although there are lots of colorful theories. My favorite is that ""hobo"" comes from the first letters in the words ""homeward bound"", but it doesn't seem very plausible. Hobos differed from ""tramps"" and ""bums"", in that ""bums"" refused to work, ""tramps"" worked when they had to, while ""hobos"" traveled in search of work."
CI_IC,"CIVIC.    	Introduced in 1972, the Honda Civic is the second-oldest brand of Japanese car made for the US today (only the Toyota Corolla has been around longer).

Her goal was to teach in India, and English was the language used there for instruction by the nuns. After Mother Teresa passed away in 1997, she was beatified by Pope John Paul II, a step on the road to canonization. In order for her to be beatified there had to be documented evidence of a miracle that was performed due to her intercession. The miracle in question was the healing of a tumor in the abdomen of a woman due to the application of a locket containing a picture of Mother Teresa. Documentation of a second miracle is required for her to be declared a saint."

The mongoose does indeed eat snakes as part of its diet, along with other small creatures.

However, in a third and final mention, Dr. Watson is called 'James' by his wife, apparently a lapse in memory on the part of the author."
CR_PS,"CRAPS.    	If one considers earlier versions of craps, then the game has been around for a very long time and probably dates back to the Crusades. Craps may be derived from an old English game called ""hazard"", also played with two dice and which was mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" from the 1300s. The American version of the game came here courtesy of the French and first set root in New Orleans where it was given the name ""crapaud"", a French word meaning ""toad""."

Shaw won his Oscar for the adapting his own play ""Pygmalion"" for the 1938 film of the same name starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.

The Falklands have been claimed as an overseas territory by various European nations, with the British having the most persistent claim from the northern hemisphere.

The dispute between Britain and Argentina came to a head in 1982 when Argentine forces invaded the Falklands.
