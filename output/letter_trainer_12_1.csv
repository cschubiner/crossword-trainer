_ETA,"BETA.    	In the world of software development, the first tested issue of a new program is usually called the ""alpha"" version.

_UR,"EUR.    	The terms 'United Kingdom', 'Great Britain' and 'England' can sometimes be confused. The official use of 'United Kingdom' originated in 1707 with the Acts of Union that declared the countries of England and Scotland as 'United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain'. The name changed again with the Acts of Union 1800 that created the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland' (much to the chagrin of most of the Irish population). This was partially reversed in 1927 when the current name was introduced, the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland', in recognition of an independent Irish Free State in the south of the island of Ireland.
