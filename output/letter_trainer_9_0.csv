It seems that it is used for developing and testing new and classified weapons facilities for the US Military and other US agencies like the CIA.

R_GU,"RAGU.    	The Ragu brand of pasta sauce is owned by Unilever. The name "" Ragù"" is the Italian word for a sauce used to dress pasta, however the spelling is off a little. In Italian the word is ""Ragù"" with a grave accent over the ""u"", but if you look at a jar of the Unilever sauce, it is spelled ""Ragú"" on the label, with an acute accent. Sometimes I think we just don't try ..."

Miller was called before the Committee himself, and was convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to 'name names'."
M_A,"MTA.    	""M.T.A."" was a 1958 hit for the Kingston Trio. The song tells of a man called Charlie who is stuck on board an MTA subway car in Boston. His problem is that ""exit fares"" had been introduced on the system to supplement ""entrance fares"" (true story!), and the man didn't have the extra nickel needed to get off the train."
GT_,"GTO.    	The Pontiac GTO was produced by GM from 1964 to 1974, and again by a GM subsidiary in Australia from 2004 to 2006. The original GTO's design is credited to Pontiac chief engineer at the time John DeLorean, who later was found the DeLorean Motor Company."

SE_A,"SELA.    	Sela Ward turns up in crosswords a lot. She played Teddy Reed in the TV show ""Sisters"" in the nineties, and was in ""Once and Again"" from 1999-2002. I don't know either show, but I do know her from the medical drama ""House"" in which she played the hospital's lawyer and Greg House's ex-partner. That was a fun role, I thought. Now she has turned up on CSI: NY, a very welcome and much-needed addition to the cast ..."

_BO,"ABO.    	The most important grouping of blood types is the ABO system. Blood is classified as either A, B, AB or O, depending on the type of antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. A secondary designation of blood is the Rh factor, in which other antigens are labelled as either positive or negative. When a patient receives a blood transfusion, ideally the donor blood should be the same type as that of the recipient, as incompatible blood cells can be rejected.

Later, in Genesis 7:2-3 Noah was instructed to take on board ""every clean animal by sevens ... male and female, to keep offspring alive on the face of all the earth"". Apparently ""extras"" (7 rather than 2) were needed for ritual sacrifice."
RA_I,"RAVI.    	Ravi Shankar was perhaps the most famous virtuoso (to us Westerners) from the world of Indian classical music, and was noted for his sitar playing. Also, Shankar was the father of the beautiful pop singer Norah Jones."
_TD,"LTD.    	There has been a lot of speculation about what the acronym LTD stands for in the car model known as ""Ford LTD"". Many say it stands for Luxury Trim Decor, and others that it is an abbreviation for ""limited"". Although the car was produced in Australia with the acronym meaning Lincoln Type Design, it seems LTD was originally chosen as just three meaningless letters that sound well together."

OM_NI,"OMANI.    	Oman lies on the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula and is neighbored by the OAE, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The capital city of Muscat has a strategic location on the Gulf of Oman and has a history of invasion and unrest. Centuries of occupation by the Persians ended in 1507 when the Portuguese took the city in a bloody attack.

The first vinyl records designed to play at 33 1/3 rpm were introduced by RCA Victor in 1931, but were discontinued due to quality problems.

D_T,"DDT.    	DDT is dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (don't forget now!). DDT was used with great success to control disease-carrying insects during WWII, and when made available for use after the war it became by far the most popular pesticide. And then Rachel Carson published her famous book ""Silent Spring"", suggesting there was a link between DDT and diminishing populations of certain wildlife. It was the public outcry sparked by the book, and reports of links between DDT and cancer, that led to the ban on the use of the chemical in 1972. That ban is touted as the main reason that the bald eagle was rescued from near extinction."

_AL,"VAL.    	Val Kilmer's first big leading role in a movie was playing Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's 1991 biopic ""The Doors"". A few years later, Morrison was chosen for the lead in another big production, ""Batman Forever"". Things haven't really gone as well for Kilmer since then, I'd say. Off the screen, he flirted with the idea of running for Governor of New Mexico in 2010. A Hollywood actor as a Governor? Would never happen ..."

Delaware is the state with the fewest counties (3), followed by Hawaii and Rhode Island (5)."
SEIN_,"SEINE.    	Paradoxically, Pont Neuf is the oldest bridge standing today that crosses the River Seine in Paris. The paradox is that ""pont neuf"" translates to 'new bridge'.

N_AH,"NOAH.    	Genesis 6:19-20 states that Noah was instructed to take two animals of every kind into the ark.

NE_L,"NELL.    	Dudley Do-Right appeared on the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, a cartoon that appeared on television in a couple of different versions from 1959-1964. Dudley was a bungling Mountie who struggled with his nemesis, the evil Snidely Whiplash, while pursuing the romantic intentions of Nell Fenwick (who always seemed to prefer Dudley's horse!)."
NO_H,"NOAH.    	The term 'ark', when used with reference to Noah, is a translation of the Hebrew word 'tebah'. The word 'tebah' is also used in the Bible for the basket in which Moses was placed by his mother when she floated him down the Nile. It seems that the word 'tebah' doesn't mean 'boat' and nor does it mean 'basket'. Rather, a more appropriate translation is 'life-preserver' or 'life-saver'. So, Noah's ark was Noah's life-preserver during the flood."
S_INE,"SEINE.    	Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh painted a whole series of paintings of the River Seine in 1886 and 1887.

On top of all that she acknowledges that she suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder as a child. It seems that she has really turned her life around ..."

AB_,"ABO.    	The most important grouping of blood types is the ABO system. Blood is classified as either A, B, AB or O, depending on the type of antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. A secondary designation of blood is the Rh factor, in which other antigens are labelled as either positive or negative. When a patient receives a blood transfusion, ideally the donor blood should be the same as that of the recipient, as incompatible blood cells can be rejected by the recipient.

P_L,"POL.    	A 'pol' is a politician, especially one known for making deals."
_YE,"LYE.    	When we purchase what is labelled as ""lye"" today, it is caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). To clean out drains we might buy Crystal Drano which is sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that that mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."
DD_,"DDT.    	DDT is dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (don't forget now!). DDT was used with great success to control disease-carrying insects during WWII, and when made available for use after the war it became by far the most popular pesticide. And then Rachel Carson published her famous book ""Silent Spring"", suggesting there was a link between DDT and diminishing populations of certain wildlife. It was the public outcry sparked by the book, and reports of links between DDT and cancer, that led to the ban on the use of the chemical in 1972. That ban is touted as the main reason that the bald eagle was rescued from near extinction."

It was while he was serving as Vice-President to in the administration of Warren G. Harding, that Coolidge earned the nickname 'Silent Cal'. There is a famous story told about Coolidge's reticence that I would love to think is true, attributed to the poet Dorothy Parker.

In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word SPAM, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets in Britain after WWII. So SPAM is used for the glut emails that take over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon."

""Salon"" focuses on American politics and current affairs, but also has articles about books, music and films. The magazine was launched in 1995, and managed to survive many loss-making years.

I've read all of Brown's books and must say that his early ones are awful ('Digital Fortress' and 'Deception Point').

Having also read 'Inferno', which was published relatively recently, I must say that to me his stories have become rather formulaic ..."

Famously, the City of London is a one-square-mile area at the center of the metropolis, the area that marked old medieval London. ""The City"", as it is commonly called, has its own Mayor of the City of London (the Mayor of London is someone else), and it's own City of London Police Force (the London Metropolitan Police are the police usually seen on the streets, a different force)."

Although the car was produced in Australia with the acronym meaning Lincoln Type Design, it seems LTD was originally chosen as just three meaningless letters that sound well together."

Hrothgar had built a great hall for his people in which they could celebrate; singing, dancing and drinking lots of mead. Grendel was angered by the carousing and attacked the hall, devouring many of the incumbent warriors as they slept. A bit of an extreme reaction to noisy neighbors I'd say ..."
DO_,"DOE.    	I am not sure that the verb ""to fawn"" can be used to mean ""give birth to a fawn"", but I guess the idea here is that a doe (female deer) can have fawns (young deer)."
A_O,"ABO.    	The most important grouping of blood types is the ABO system. Blood is classified as either A, B, AB or O, depending on the type of antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. A secondary designation of blood is the Rh factor, in which other antigens are labelled as either positive or negative. When a patient receives a blood transfusion, ideally the donor blood should be the same type as that of the recipient, as incompatible blood cells can be rejected.

There's an oft-quoted story that the explorer James Cook (later Captain Cook) asked a local native what was the name of this remarkable-looking animal, and the native responded with 'kangaroo'. The story is that the native was actually saying 'I don't understand you', but as cute as that tale is, it's just an urban myth."
GNA_,"GNAT.    	This one is new to me: 'Don't strain a gnat and swallow a camel'. The idiom comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: 'Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone. Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.' I think the idea being conveyed in the idiom is that one is making a big deal out of small thing while enduring bigger trials."

The name is Japanese for 'Sulfur Island', referring to the sulfur mining on which Iwo Jima's economy once depended. There were about a thousand Japanese civilians living on the island prior to WWII.

A_U,"APU.    	The fictional store, Kwik-E-Mart, is operated by Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, on ""The Simpsons"" TV show. The convenience store owner doesn't seem to be making much use of his Ph.

His most famous novel probably is his first, ""Lucky Jim"" published in 1954, although he won a Booker Prize for a later novel, ""The Old Devils"" published in 1986. He passed on some of his talent through his genes, it seems, as his son Martin Amis is a very successful novelist too."

A_C,"ARC.    	The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris is located close to the more famous Arc de Triomphe de l'Etoile.

Examples are the use of ""s"" over ""c"" in words like ""defense"" (In Ireland we have defence and defense depending on usage), ""-re"" became ""-er"" as in center instead of centre (reversing the influence of French), and he dropped one of the Ls in words like traveler (I learned ""traveller"").

ENRO_,"ENRON.    	Enron Field, as it was known, is a retractable-roof ballpark that was built next to Houston's old Union Station. Enron paid $100 million to get its name on the field, and then when the world found out what a scam Enron actually was, the Astros bought back the contract for the name, for a mere $2.1 million. The stadium became Astros Field for a few months, until the Coke people paid $170 million for a 28-year contract to christen the stadium Minute Maid Park. A good deal for the Astros, I'd say."
AM_S,"AMIS.    	I suppose the successful English novelist Martin Amis must have writing in his blood. He is the son of the respected author Kingsley Amis, a Booker Prize winner.

Note that in the original spelling of ""latte"", the Italian word for milk, there is no accent over the ""e"". An accent is often added by mistake when we use the word in English, perhaps meaning to suggest that the word is French."
S_AN,"SEAN.    	Sean Parker came to national attention in 1998 as co-founder of Napster, the file-sharing service for music that created such a fuss in the recording industry. He started to advise the founders of Facebook in 2004, and became the company's first president later that year.

_YE,"LYE.    	Today when we purchase what is labelled as ""lye"", it is caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). To clean out drains we might buy Crystal Drano which is sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that that mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."

A few years later he was chosen for the lead in another big production, ""Batman Forever"". Things haven't really gone as well for Kilmer since then, I'd say. Off the screen, he flirted with the idea of running for Governor of New Mexico in 2010. A Hollywood actor as a Governor? Would never happen ..."

The movie stars Constance Bennett and Cary Grant, and was successful enough to merit two sequels. The television series stars Robert Sterling and Anne Jeffreys in the Grant/Bennett roles.

S_S,"SES.    	Dijon is a city in eastern France, in the Burgundy region. Dijon is famous for its mustard, a particularly strong variation of the condiment. The European Union doesn't protect the name ""Dijon"" so anyone can use it on a label.

ANI_E,"ANISE.    	Liquorice (also licorice) and aniseed have similar flavors, but they come from unrelated plants. The liquorice plant is a legume like a bean, and the sweet flavor is an extract from the roots. The flavor mainly comes from an ether compound called anethole, the same substance that gives the distinctive flavor to anise. The seedpods of the anise plant are what we know as ""aniseed"". The anise seeds themselves are usually ground to release the flavor."
_RNE,"ERNE.    	The ern (also erne) is also called the white-tailed eagle, and the sea-eagle."
C_I,"CHI.    	It seems that the derivation of Chicago's nickname as the ""Windy City"" isn't as obvious as I would have thought. There are two viable theories. First the weather can be breezy, with wind blowing in off Lake Michigan. The effect of the wind is exaggerated by the grid-layout adopted by city planners after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The second theory is that the ""windy"" means being full of bluster. Sportswriters from the rival city of Cincinnati were fond of calling Chicago supporters ""windy"" in the 1860s and 1870s, meaning that they were full of hot air in their claims that the Chicago White Stockings were superior to the Cincinnati Red Stockings."
