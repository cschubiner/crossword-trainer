This new sound detection system was described as using ""supersonics"", but for the purpose of secrecy the term was dropped in favor of an acronym. The work was done under the auspices of the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Division, so ASD was combined with the IC from ""superson-ic-s"") to create the name ASDIC. The navy even went as far as renaming the quartz material at the heart of the technology ""ASDivite"".
