Prior to the fight, Louis was invited to the White House, where President Roosevelt told him ""Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany."" Louis won the rematch in spectacular style, knocking Schmeling to the canvas three times in a bout that lasted just two minutes and four seconds. Schmeling only managed to throw two punches."

The word ' portmanteau' is French for a 'travelling bag', from 'porter' (to carry) and 'manteau' (a coat, cloak). We also use 'portmanteau' to mean a word that has been melded together from two parts (just like the suitcase). This usage was introduced to the world by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'.

I_ATREE,IN A TREE.    	The somewhat cruel kid's rhyme goes:
STAT_,"STATE.    	The people from what today is Washington state first petitioned the US Congress for statehood in 1852. At that time the proposal was to name the new state Columbia, but this was rejected as it was felt that a state called Columbia might be confused with the District of Columbia. Somewhat bizarrely, the alternative name of Washington was accepted. Certainly, the name Washington honors the first President, but there's still potential confusion with the nation's capital. I hate to admit my ignorance, but as a young man in Ireland whenever I heard talk of Washington state, I assumed the discussion was about Washington DC ..."
_IRK,"DIRK.    	""Dirk"" is the Scots word for dagger, and is the name given to a knife that is worn hanging from a belt in traditional dress that includes a kilt.

T_KES,"TYKES.    	""Tyke"" has been used playfully to describe a young child since at least 1902, but for centuries before that a tyke was a cur or mongrel, or perhaps a lazy or lower-class man."
LO_AN,"LOMAN.    	'Death of a Salesman' is a famous play by Arthur Miller, first produced in 1949. 'Death of a Salesman' won a Pulitzer and several Tony Awards over the years.

TER_,"TERM.    	A candidate can only be elected into the office of US President twice.

However, in theory one can succeed to the office of President an unlimited number of times."

PRA_K,"PRANK.    	I remember the first time I fell victim to the prank of ""short-sheeting"", and very perplexing it is too! The idea is to leave the bottom sheet as is, and tuck the top sheet under the mattress at the head of the bed, just as one would do with a bottom sheet. Then fold the foot of the top sheet back up to the head of the bed, and fold it as one would do normally for a top sheet. Don't tell your Mom it was me who told you how to do it though ..."
_EWEL,"NEWEL.    	A newel is a principal upright post that supports a handrail beside a staircase. Newels are found at the top and bottom of the banister, and sometimes in between. Newels are often adorned with decorative trim to set them apart from the other posts by the staircase."

K_NTS,"KENTS.    	""Readers Digest"" published an exposé article in 1952 called ""Cancer in the Carton"", creating a scare among cigarette smokers. In response, tobacco manufacturers introduced cigarettes with filters, creating the impression that this would mitigate the harmful effects of smoking. One of the new brands was Kent, which had a much-touted ""Micronite filter"". However, in 1956 it was revealed that Kent cigarettes were made with carcinogenic blue asbestos in the filter, so there was a quick reformulation and a replacement with charcoal. The Kent brand is named after Herbert Kent, a former executive of the Lorillard Tobacco Company."

And, did you know that Nora Ephron's second marriage was to journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame?"
MO_K,"MORK.    	""Mork & Mindy"" was broadcast from 1978 to 1982. We were first introduced to Mork (played by Robin Williams, of course) in a special episode of ""Happy Days"". The particular episode in question has a bizarre storyline culminating in Fonzie and Mork having a thumb-to-finger duel. Eventually Richie wakes up in bed, and alien Mork was just part of a dream! Oh, and ""Nanu Nanu"" means both ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" back on the planet Ork. ""I am Mork from Ork, Nanu Nanu"". Great stuff ..."
ONEB_,"ONE BC.    	The designations Anno Domini (AD, ""year of Our Lord"") and Before Christ (BC) are found in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The dividing point between AD and BC is the year of the conception of Jesus, with AD 1 following 1 BC without a year ""0"" in between. The AD/BC scheme dates back to AD 525, and gained wide acceptance soon after AD 800.

MAR_BARS,"MARS BARS.    	Having lived on both sides of the Atlantic, I find the Mars Bar to be the most perplexing of candies! The original Mars Bar is a British confection (and delicious) first manufactured in 1932. The US version of the original Mars Bar is called a Milky Way. But a Milky Way is also produced in the UK, and it is completely different to its US cousin, and is more like an American ""3 Musketeers"". And there is an American Mars Bar, something different again. No wonder I gave up eating candy bars ..."
_WEET,"TWEET.    	I have never tweeted in my life, and have no plans to do so. Twitter is a micro-blogging service that limits the post sent to just 140 characters. In a sense, it is similar to this blog. Here I send out a post once a day containing information that I think might be useful to folks (thank you for reading!). I don't think I could send much of interest using just 140 characters. I believe that many people who do tweet tend to send out messages like ""I'm at dinner now. I am having sushi"" and ""There's nothing on TV. I'm bored"". Nope, I don't think so!"

The original alcoholic version actually contained a small concentration of cocaine."

NESS_E,"NESSIE.    	The 'Surgeon's Photograph' is an image that was taken in 1934, supposedly of the Loch Ness monster.

Heft complained about the B-minus and was jokingly told that his grade would only be reconsidered if the design was accepted by congress.

Sarah Ferguson was in the news relatively recently when she was the target of a sting operation by a British tabloid newspaper. She was caught asking for 500,000 British pounds in order to help facilitate access to her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, and actually accepted 40,000 pounds in an envelope. After being exposed, Ferguson made the excuse that she had been drinking prior to soliciting the cash."
_OIREE,"SOIREE.    	""Soir"" is the French word for ""evening"" and a ""soirée"" is an ""evening party"". The French word ""soirée"" has an acute accent over the first ""e"", but we tend to drop this when using the word in English."

CF_,"CFC.    	Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are the propellants that were once used in aerosols. CFCs make their way up into the ozone layer and trigger a chain reaction that converts ozone (O3) into regular oxygen (O2). That conversion creates 'holes' in the ozone layer. Regular O2 is good stuff, but we need O3 to absorb harmful UV radiation raining down on us. CFC is not good stuff ..."
A_ORAE,"AGORAE.    	In early Greece the ""agora"" was a place of assembly. Often the assemblies held in the agora were quite formal, perhaps for the reading of a proclamation.

_ORK,"PORK.    	Pork barrel politics have been around for a long time. The term originated in 1863 in a story by Edward Everett Hale called ""The Children of the Public"". Hale used ""pork barrel"" in a positive way, describing any public spending by government for the benefit of citizens. By the 1870s the term ""pork"" had negative connotations, with references in the press to ""pork barrel bills"" in Congress. Nowadays ""pork"" really applies to any government project designed to benefit a relatively small group of citizens (usually potential voters for a particular politician) with the bill being paid by the citizenry as a whole."
ES_ENES,"ESSENES.    	The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered over a period of years, between 1947 and 1956, in eleven caves on the shores of the Dead Sea.

RONI_,"RONIN.    	I haven't seen ""Ronin"", a 1998 action thriller about a group of ex-special forces and intelligence agents who collaborate to steal a mysterious suitcase. It stars Robert De Niro and Jean Reno, and sounds like my kind of film."
ST_O,"STRO.    	Enron Field, as it was known, is a retractable-roof ballpark that was built next to Houston's old Union Station. Enron paid $100 million to get its name on the field, and then when the world found out what a scam Enron actually was, the Astros bought back the contract for the name, for a mere $2.1 million. The stadium became Astros Field for a few months, until the Coke people paid $170 million for a 28-year contract to christen the stadium Minute Maid Park. A good deal for the Astros, I'd say."
_ARY,"CARY.    	Cary Grant was an actor from England who made it big, really big in Hollywood. 'Cary Grant' is a stage name, chosen by Archibald Leach. There's a great moment in the film 'His Girl Friday' when Grant says the line 'I never had so much fun since Archie Leach died', an inside joke."
_FCS,"CFCS.    	Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are the propellants that were once used in aerosols. CFCs make their way up into the ozone layer and trigger a chain reaction that converts ozone (O3) into regular oxygen (O2). That conversion creates 'holes' in the ozone layer. Regular O2 is good stuff, but we need O3 to absorb harmful UV radiation raining down on us. CFC is not good stuff ..."
H_ATT,"HYATT.    	The Hyatt hotel chain takes its name from the first hotel in the group, that was purchased in 1957 i.e. Hyatt House at Los Angeles International Airport. Among other things, Hyatt is famous for designing the world's first atrium hotel, the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta."

_PTS,"APTS.    	The words 'condominium' and 'apartment' tend to describe the same type of residential property, a private living space with facilities shared with others residing in the same building or complex. The difference is that a condominium is usually owned, and an apartment is rented. At least that's how it is in the US. The word 'condominium' comes from the Latin 'com' (together) and 'dominum' (right of ownership)."
HER_IT,"HERMIT.    	Hermit crabs are so called because they 'live alone' in an abandoned shell, usually one that originally housed a sea snail. The crab uses the shell to protect its soft abdomen. Instead of shells, hermit crabs have been found dragging around hollow stones or even hollowed out pieces of wood."

The resulting ashes are mixed with sacred oil and then used to anoint worshipers on the forehead with the shape of a cross."
_SETSES,"TSETSES.    	Tsetse flies live on the blood of vertebrate mammals. The name ""tsetse"" comes from Tswana, a language of southern Africa, and translates simply as ""fly"". Tsetse flies are famous for being carriers of the disease known as ""sleeping sickness"". Sleeping sickness is caused by a parasite which is passed onto humans when the tsetse fly bites into human skin tissue. If one considers all the diseases transmitted by the insect, then the tsetse fly is responsible for a staggering quarter of a million deaths each year."
AB_R,"A BAR.    	This guy walks into a bar and says to the bartender, ""Give me 12 shots of your most expensive Tequila!"" The bartender pours the shots and lines them up. The guy starts shooting them back really quickly, one right after another. The bartender says in shock, ""Why are you drinking those so fast?!"" The guy stops long enough to get out a few words, ""You would drink these fast too, if you had what I have"" Confused, the bartender asks, ""Why? what do you have?"" The guy says, ""About four dollars"" ..."
_EAN,"JEAN.    	Jean Shepherd was a story teller and radio personality, most remembered today for the 1983 film 'A Christmas Story', which he co-wrote and narrated.

'Yesterday' wasn't originally released as a single and first appeared as a track on the 1965 Beatles album, 'Help!' In several polls over in the UK, 'Yesterday' has been named the number one pop song of all time."
HO_E,"HOPE.    	In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman. Pandora is famous for the story of ""Pandora's Box"". In actual fact, the story should be about Pandora's ""Jar"", as a 16th-century error in translation created a ""box"" out of the ""jar""."

SC_B,"SCAB.    	We first started calling strikebreakers ""scabs"" in the early 1800s, and before that a scab was a person who refused to join a trade union (back as early 1777). The word probably comes from the use of ""scab"" as a skin disease, and so is a term that is meant to insult."

When the third edition was published in 2007, the longest entry for a single word became the verb ""put"".

C_PE,"CAPE.    	The Cape of Good Hope in South Africa is not, as I believed, the most southerly point of Africa. That honor goes to Cape Agulhas, which lies just under a hundred miles further south. The first European to reach 'the Cape' was Bartolomeu Dias in 1448, and he called the headland the Cape of Storms. It was renamed by John II, King of Portugal, as the Cape of Good Hope as discovery of the Cape led to a spirit of optimism with the opening of a sea route from Europe to India and beyond."
LE_,"LEU.    	The currency of Romania is the leu (plural: lei), a word meaning ""lion"". The leu is also the name of the currency of neighboring Moldova. Romania joined the European Union in 2007, and is planning on moving to the Euro in 2014."
STA_E,"STATE.    	Saxony was the name given at different times in history to states along the Elbe river in central Europe. As the various states broke up, they spawned many duchies that retained the name ""Saxe"". The most famous of these duchies was probably Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, two united duchies in Germany that ceased to exist after WWII. A notable branch of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha House is the British Royal Family, as Queen Victoria was married to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. King George V of the United Kingdom changed the name of the family to the House of Windsor in a politically sensible move during WWI."

Kipling wrote the piece on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, and used it to express sadness at the waning of the British Empire.

Ever since WWI we've been using the words on memorials as a plea not forget the sacrifices made by others in the past."

Lubin introduced a cream cheesecake that he named after his daughter who was only 8-years-old at the time, Sara Lee Lubin. The cheesecake was a hit and he renamed the bakeries to Kitchen of Sara Lee. The business was bought out by Consolidated foods in 1956, but the brand name Sara Lee persists to this day, as does Ms. Sara Lee herself who now goes by the name Sara Lee Schupf."

_OGEY,"BOGEY.    	The term ""Bogey"" originated at the Great Yarmouth Golf Club in England in 1890, and was used to indicate a total round that was one over par (and not one over par on a particular hole, as it is today). The name Bogey came from a music hall song of the time ""Here Comes the Bogey Man"". In the following years it became popular for players trying to stay at par to be ""playing against Colonel Bogey"". Then, during WWI, the marching tune ""Colonel Bogey"" was written and named after the golfing term. If you don't recognize the name of the tune, it's the one that's whistled by the soldiers marching in the great movie ""The Bridge on the River Kwai""."
L_BON,"LE BON.    	The English Band Duran Duran's lead singer is Simon Le Bon. Le Bon is a passionate sailor and garnered a lot of attention when his yacht lost its keel in the 1985 Fastnet race.

Mobuto was known to be a very corrupt dictator and it is believed that he embezzled over $5 billion from his country. On a lighter note, Mobutu was the money man behind the famous 1974 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman known as 'The Rumble in the Jungle'. Mobutu was anxious to expand the image of Zaire so he used his nation's funds to entice the fighters to have a go at each other in his homeland."
S_GET,"SAGET.    	Bob Saget is a real enigma to me. He made a name for himself playing very sugary roles in TV shows like ""Full House"" and ""America's Funniest Home Videos"", and yet in the world of stand-up comedy he is known for very blue and raunchy routines."

_LCAN,"ALCAN.    	The Alaska Highway is also known as the Alaska-Canadian Highway or ALCAN Highway. A highway connecting the contiguous United States to Alaska was proposed in the twenties, but the Canadian authorities didn't believe the project had much merit as the road would be used by very few of its citizens. The perceived importance of the route increased during WWII and President Roosevelt deemed the road a strategic necessity so he made a deal with Canada. The cost of construction would be born by the US, but the road and related facilities were to be handed over to Canada at the end of the war. The project was accelerated when the Japanese invaded and occupied Kiska and Attu Islands in the Aleutians. The road of course has been improved and is still in use today. The ALCAN Highway forms part of what is popularly known as the Pan-American Highway, which runs from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska to the south of Argentina or Chile depending on how the route is defined."

Mozart and his wife had six children, but only two survived infancy. The youngest boy was called Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart, born just five months before his father died.
