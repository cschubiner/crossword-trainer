H_T,"HAT.    	I think a bowler hat is called a derby here in the US. The bowler was first produced in 1849 in London by hatmakers Thomas and William Bowler, hence the name. The alternative name of ""derby"" comes from the tradition of wearing bowler hats at the Derby horse race (a major race held annually in England)."

The first Academy Awards were presented at a brunch in 1929 with an audience of just 29 people. The Awards ceremony is a slightly bigger event these days ..."
SEE_,"SEER.    	I think Cassandra is such a great name, translating from Greek as ""she who entangles men"". The Cassandra of Greek mythology was so beautiful that Apollo gave her the gift of prophecy. There is another story though, that she gained her gift as a seer by spending the night in Apollo's temple where snakes licked her ears clean so that she could hear the future. Ugh ..."
C_S,"COS.    	The most familiar trigonometric functions are sine, cosine and tangent. Each of these is a ratio, a ratio of two sides of a right-angled triangle.

Tutankhamen's magnificent burial mask is one of the most recognizable of all Egyptian artifacts."
TON_R,"TONER.    	The key features of a laser printer (or copier) are that it uses plain paper and produces quality text at high speed. Laser printers work by projecting a laser image of the printed page onto a rotating drum that is coated with photoconductors (material that becomes conductive when exposed to light). The areas of the drum exposed to the laser carry a different charge than the unexposed areas. Dry ink (called toner) sticks to the unexposed areas due to electrostatic charge. The toner is then transferred to paper by contact and is fused into the paper by the application of heat. So, that explains why paper coming out of a laser printer is warm, and sometimes powdery ..."

OCELO_,"OCELOT.    	The ocelot is found mainly in South and Central America, although there have been sightings as far north as Arkansas. An ocelot doesn't look too different from a domestic cat, and some have been kept as pets. Perhaps most famously, Salvador Dali had one that he carried around everywhere with him."
Z_NE,"ZANE.    	Zane Grey sure did hit on the right niche. He wrote romanticized western novels and stories that really lent themselves to the big screen in the days when westerns were very popular. Incredibly, 110 films were made based on his work."

""The Onion"" newspaper was founded by two college students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1988. The founders sold the operation a year later for about $20,000. The paper grew steadily until 1996 when it began to publish online and really took off. I think it's worth a tad more than $20,000 today ..."
PA_,"PAM.    	In the excellent sitcom 'The Office', the character Pam Halpert (née Beesly) is played very ably by the lovely Jenna Fischer. If you've seen the original version of 'The Office' from the UK, then you'd have met Pam's equivalent character, Dawn Tinsley."

K_IS,"KRIS.    	In the fun TV show from the late seventies and early eighties, 'Charlie's Angels', Farrah Fawcett-Majors played Jill Munroe. When Fawcett-Majors decided to move on, a new character was introduced to fill her spot, her younger sister, Kris Munroe, played by Cheryl Ladd."

Something that comes out of test tube shouldn't be in our food ..."
A_ETE,"ARETE.    	An arete is ridge of rock defining the border between two parallel valleys that have been formed by glaciation. If the ridge between the valleys is rounded, it is called a ""col"".

ARM_DA,"ARMADA.    	The most famous Armada was the Spanish fleet that sailed against England in order to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I in 1588. It failed in its mission, partly due to bad weather encountered en route. Ironically, the English mounted a similar naval attack against Spain the following year, and it failed as well."

IC_M,"ICBM.    	An Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) is a ballistic missile with the range necessary to cross between continents. Being ballistic (unlike a cruise missile), an ICBM is guided during the initial launch phase, but later in flight just relies on thrust and gravity to arrive at its target.

NO_E,"NOME.    	Nome, Alaska has over 3,500 residents, the majority of whom are Native American. The next largest ethnic group in Nome is the white population. The origin of the name 'Nome' isn't well understood, it seems. One theory is that was a misunderstanding of the local Inupiaq word for the phrase 'Where at?'"
EREST_,"ERES TU.    	We have a big event across Europe every year called the Eurovision Song Contest. Each nation enters one song in competition with each other, and then voters across the whole continent decide on the winner. That's how ABBA got their big break, as they were Sweden's entry debuting their song ""Waterloo"". In 1972, Spain's entry was ""Eres tu"" sung by the band Mocedades. ""Eres tu"" is the Spanish for ""you are"". It is a great song, that came in second but should have won, in my humble opinion."
_EC,"AEC.    	The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was set up right after WWII in 1946, with the aim of promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy. Establishing the AEC was a significant move made by President Truman, as it passed control of atomic energy from the military to the civilian sector. The AEC continued to operate until 1974 when its functions were divided up into two new agencies: the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."
PIA_O,"PIANO.    	What was remarkable about the piano when it was invented, compared to other keyboard instruments, was that notes could be played with varying degrees of loudness. This is accomplished by pressing the keys lightly or firmly. Because of this quality, the new instrument was called a 'pianoforte', with 'piano' and 'forte' meaning 'soft' and 'loud' in Italian. We tend to shorten the name these days to just 'piano'."
_DAS,PDAS.    	Personal digital assistant (PDA)
RA_E,"RARE.    	I wasn't sure of the origin of the term ""leap year"", and when I checked I found it to be fairly obvious. As a reference, let's use March 25, 2007, a Sunday. The year before, in 2006, March 25th fell one weekday earlier on a Saturday, following the rule that each year any particular date moves forward in the week by one day. However, the next year (208) has an extra day, February 29th. So March 25, 2008 falls on a Tuesday, ""leaping"" two weekdays forward, not one, as 2008 is a ""leap"" year. I think I am more confused now then when I started this paragraph ..."
SA_YR,"SATYR.    	The satyrs of Greek mythology came with a very high sex drive. They are the ""rude"" male subjects drawn on the side of old Greek vases. The nubile maidens known as nymphs were often an object of attention for the satyrs."

Haiti is one of only two nations in the Americas to have French as an official language, the other being Canada."
_TPAT,"ST PAT.    	There is a fair amount known about St. Patrick, some of which comes from two letters written in his own hand. St. Patrick lived in the fifth century, but was not born in Ireland. He was first brought to Ireland at about 16 years of age from his native Britain, by Irish raiders who made him a slave for six years. Patrick managed to escape and returned to his homeland where he studied and entered the Church. He went back to Ireland as a bishop and a missionary and there lived out the rest of his life. There seems to be good evidence that he died on March 17th (now celebrated annually as St. Patrick's Day), although the year is less clear. The stories about shamrock and snakes, I am afraid they are the stuff of legend."
CLAR_,"CLARA.    	Clara Bow was a fabulous star of silent film, with her most famous movie being ""It"" from 1927. Clara Bow's performance was so celebrated in the movie that she was forever to be known as the ""It-girl"". The term ""it"" was a euphemism for ""sex appeal"", and that is what Clara Bow was known to ""exude"". Bow applied her red lipstick in the shape of a heart, and women who copied this style were said to put on a ""Clara Bow""."
S_NEW,"SINEW.    	Sinew is another name for a tendon. Tendons are bands of collagen that connect muscle to bone.

EEN_E,"EENIE.    	""Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,"
_LOC,BLOC.    	'Bloc' is the French word for 'block'.
_IT,"AIT.    	Aits are little islands found usually in a river. Aits aren't typically formed by erosion, but by the deposition of silt over time. As a result, aits often have a long and narrow shape, running the length of the river, as the sediment builds up with the flow of the water. The word ""ait"" comes from the Middle English ""eyt"", which in turn comes from Old English ""ieg"", the word for an ""island"". Many of the islands in the River Thames have been given the name Ait, like Raven's Ait in Kingston-upon-Thames, and Lot's Ait in Brentford."
L_IA,"LEIA.    	Princess Leia is Luke Skywalker's twin sister in the original 'Star Wars' trilogy and was played by Carrie Fisher. Carrie Fisher has stated that she hated the famous 'cinnamon bun hairstyle' that she had to wear in the films, as she felt it made her face look too round.

_ARI,"BARI.    	Saint Nicholas of Myra is the inspiration for Santa Claus. Nicholas was the Bishop of Myra (now in modern-day Turkey) during the 4th century AD, and was known for being generous to the poor. Centuries after he died his remains were desecrated by Italian sailors and moved to Bari in Italy. One legend has it that the relics were moved again centuries later and reburied in the grounds of Jerpoint Abbey in Co. Kilkenny in Ireland, where you can visit the grave today. I choose to believe that Santa Claus's relics are indeed buried in Ireland ..."
FL_,"FLA.    	Marco Rubio is the junior US Senator from Florida, a member of the Republican Party who has been in office since January 2011. Senator Rubio&#8217;s name has been closely associated with the Tea Party movement. "

Years later, the company developed a new brand, Royal Crown Cola (also known as RC Cola). By 1955, RC Cola was the company's flagship product, so the ""Nehi Corporation"" became Royal Crown Company."

_DAS,PDAS.    	Personal digital assistant (PDA)
_ENA,"NENA.    	Nena is a German singer (Nena became the name of her band as well), and she had a big hit with one of my favorite songs of the eighties, ""99 Luftballons"" (and the version she recorded in English: ""99 Red Balloons""). The English translation of the title isn't literal, with the color ""red"" added just so that the title had the right number of syllables. A ""Luftballon"" is the name given to a child's toy balloon in German."
S_U,SOU.    	A sou is an old French coin. We use the term 'sou' to mean 'an almost worthless amount'.
PE_,"PEZ.    	PEZ is an Austrian brand name for a particular candy sold in a mechanical dispenser. Famously, PEZ dispensers have molded 'heads', and have become very collectible over the years.

The name PEZ comes from the first, middle and last letters of ""Pfefferminz"", the German word for ""peppermint""."
_OSCA,"TOSCA.    	Unlike so many operas, ""Tosca"" was a big hit right from day one, when it was first performed in 1900 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. ""Tosca"" is currently the eighth-most performed opera in America, although I've only seen it once myself."
NEN_,"NENA.    	Nena is a German singer (Nena became the name of her band as well), and she had a big hit with one of my favorite songs of the eighties, ""99 Luftballons"" (or the version she recorded in English: ""99 Red Balloons"").

A ""Luftballon"" is the name given to a child's toy balloon (as opposed to a larger, utilitarian balloon)."
PES_O,"PESTO.    	The term 'pesto' applies to anything made by pounding. What we tend to know as 'pesto' sauce is more properly called 'pesto alla genovese', pesto from Genoa in northern Italy. I love, love pesto sauce ..."

Carrie Fisher has stated that she hated the famous ""cinnamon bun hairstyle"" that she had to wear in the films, as she felt it made her face look too round.

N_MSG,"NO MSG.    	Monosodium glutamate is the sodium salt of a naturally-occurring (and non-essential) amino acid, glutamic acid. It is used widely as a flavor enhancer, particularly in many Asian cuisines. Whether or not it is harmful seems to be still under debate. I say that something produced in a test tube shouldn't be in our food ..."
SNA_U,"SNAFU.    	SNAFU is an acronym standing for Situation Normal: All Fouled Up (well, that's the ""polite"" version!). As you might imagine, the term developed in the US Army, during WWII."
_CAM,"SCAM.    	'Flim-flam' is another word for a confidence trick. The term has been in use since the 1500s, would you believe?"
R_RE,"RARE.    	There are five types of rhinoceros that survive today, and the smaller Javan Rhino is the most rare. The rhinoceros is probably the rarest large mammal on the planet, thanks to poaching. Hunters mainly prize the horn of the rhino as it is used in powdered form in traditional Chinese medicine."

TOT_M,"TOTEM.    	Totem is the name given to any entity that watches over a group of people. As such, totems are usually the subjects of worship. So, ""totem poles"" are really misnamed as the poles are not intended to represent figures to be worshiped, but rather are heraldic in nature often celebrating the legends or notable events in the history of a tribe."
_IG,"AIG.    	AIG is the American International Group, a giant insurance corporation (or I should say, ""was""). After repeated bailouts by American taxpayers, the company made some serious PR blunders by spending large amounts of money on executive entertainment and middle management rewards. These included a $444,000 California retreat, an $86,000 hunting trip in England, and a $343,000 getaway to a luxury resort in Phoenix. Poor judgment, I'd say ..."

PI_NO,"PIANO.    	What was remarkable about the piano when it was invented, compared to other keyboard instruments, was that notes could be played with varying degrees of loudness. This is accomplished by pressing the keys lightly or firmly. Because of this quality, the new instrument was called a 'pianoforte', with 'piano' and 'forte' meaning 'soft' and 'loud' in Italian. We tend to shorten the name these days to just 'piano'."
_NE,"ENE.    	Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road"" is largely autobiographical, telling the story of Sal Paradise (Jack K.) and the road trips that he and his friends took across the country in the fifties."

The event is a race on horseback from one end of the arena to the other, where there is a goat tethered to a stake on the end of a 10-foot rope.

HAIT_,"HAITI.    	The capital city of Haiti is Port-au-Prince. The city was hit by a devastating earthquake in January of 2010. The official government estimate of the death toll stands at 230,000 people, with many bodies never recovered."

_YNE,"SYNE.    	The song 'Auld Lang Syne' is a staple at New Year's Eve (well, actually in the opening minutes of New Year's Day). The words were written by Scottish poet Robbie Burns.

L_ON,LEON.    	Nuevo León is a Mexican state located across the border from the US state of Texas. The capital city of Nuevo León is Monterrey.
L_ICA,"LEICA.    	Leica is a German optics company, famous for production of lenses and cameras. The 1913 Leica was the first practical camera that could use 35mm film, a size chosen because it was already the standard for film used in motion pictures."

DA_,"DAD.    	Father's Day was added as an official holiday in 1972, although bills to create the holiday had been with Congress since 1913. By rights, the holiday should be called 'Fathers' Day' (note the punctuation), but the Bill that was introduced in 1913 used the 'Father's Day' spelling, and that's the one that has stuck."
ET_EL,"ETHEL.    	Ethel Barrymore was one of the famous Barrymore family of actors. Ethel was the sister of John and Lionel Barrymore. Ethel was a close friend of Winston Churchill, and some even say that Winston even proposed to her."
I_H,"ICH.    	""Ich"" is the German for ""I"", as in ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" (I am a Berliner), the famous words of support uttered by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 in a speech in West Berlin. The supposed translation of ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" as ""I am a jelly doughnut"" ... that's just an urban myth. President Kennedy's use of German was perfectly correct."
P_SCI,"PESCI.    	Joe Pesci got his big break in movies with a supporting role in ""Raging Bull"" starring Robert De Niro, earning Pesci an Oscar nomination early in his career. There followed a string of gangster roles played alongside De Niro, namely ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". But I like Pesci's comedic acting best of all. He was marvelous in the ""Home Alone"" films, the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and my personal favorite, ""My Cousin Vinny"". Pesci gets a mention in the stage musical ""Jersey Boys"", which isn't too surprising as he is one of the show's producers."

_NE,"-ANE.    	Alkanes are organic compounds. The 'smaller' alkanes are gases and are quite combustible. Methane (CH4) is the main component of natural gas with ethane (C2H6) being the second largest component. Propane (C3H8) is another component of natural gas and is heavy enough to be readily turned into a liquid by compression for ease of transportation and storage. Butane (C4H10) is also easily liquefied under pressure and can be used as the fuel in cigarette lighters or as the propellant in aerosol sprays. The heavier alkanes are not gases, and instead are liquids and solids at room temperature."
ER_O,"ERNO.    	What was originally called the 'Magic Cube' became better known as Rubik's Cube, named for its inventor Ernő Rubik. Rubik's Cube is the world's biggest selling puzzle game, with over 350 million sold in just over 30 years."

K_RR,"KERR.    	The lovely Deborah Kerr was a Scottish actress who made a real name for herself on the American stage and in the movies. Despite all her success, and six nominations for a Best Actress Oscar, she never actually won an Academy Award.

The Emperor was billeted at Solferino, where France and Austria were engaged in a major battle. In one day, Dunant witnessed 40,000 soldiers die in battle, and countless wounded suffering on the battlefield without any organized medical care. Dunant abandoned his business agenda and instead spent a week caring for the sick and wounded. Within a few years he had founded the precursor to the Red Cross, and in 1901 was awarded the first ever Nobel Peace Prize."
AN_,"-ANE.    	Alkanes are organic compounds. The 'smaller' alkanes are gases and are quite combustible. Methane (CH4) is the main component of natural gas with ethane (C2H6) being the second largest component.

_TOLL,"ATOLL.    	An atoll is a coral island that is shaped in a ring and enclosing a lagoon. There is still some debate as to how an atoll forms, but a theory proposed by Charles Darwin while on his famous voyage aboard HMS Beagle still holds sway.

The coastline of the island is home to coral growth which persists even as the island continues to subside internal to the circling coral reef."

I per se I, J, K, L ... denoting that the letters A and I are also their own words. It was common to add the & symbol at the end of the recitation, as if it were a 27th letter. So the alphabet ended with 'X, Y, Z, & (and) per se and'. This 'and per se and' statement was slurred to 'ampersand', giving the name that we use today for the & symbol."
_DC,"CDC.    	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is based in Atlanta, Georgia. The CDC started out life during WWII as the Office of National Defense Malaria Control Activities. The CDC worries about much more than malaria these days ..."

By the way, GM Daewoo is the third largest manufacturer of automobiles in South Korea, after Hyundai and Kia."
I_S,"IQS.    	If you ever had to learn Latin, as did I, ""mensa"" was probably taught to you in Lesson One as it's the word commonly used as an example of a first declension noun.

M_T,"MET.    	MetLife is the familiar name for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. MetLife was founded way back in 1868, and is headquartered in New York City."
A_S,"ADS.    	If you haven't seen the AMC show ""Mad Men"" then I urge you to go buy the first season on DVD and allow yourself to get addicted. It is a great series set in the sixties, telling all that goes on in and around the advertising business on Madison Avenue in New York City. It brings you right back to the days of three-martini lunches, office affairs, and chain-smoking of cigarettes. Great stuff ..."

_OL,"COL.    	Colonel Sherman Potter is a character on the memorable TV series ""M*A*S*H'. Potter was played by actor Harry Morgan.

P_SCI,"PESCI.    	Joe Pesci got his big break in movies with a supporting role in ""Raging Bull"", earning him an Oscar nomination early in his career. There followed a string of gangster roles played alongside De Niro, namely ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". But I like his comedic acting best of all. He was marvelous in the ""Home Alone"" films, the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and my personal favorite, ""My Cousin Vinnie"". Pesci gets a mention in the stage musical ""Jersey Boys"", which isn't too surprising as he is one of the show's producers."
S_D,"SID.    	Sid Caesar achieved fame in the fifties on TV's ""Your Show of Shows"". To be honest, I know Sid Caesar mainly from the fun film version of the musical ""Grease"", in which he played Coach Calhoun."

A_C,"AEC.    	The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was set up right after WWII in 1946, with the aim of promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy. Establishing the AEC was a significant move made by President Truman, as it passed control of atomic energy from the military to the civilian sector.

T_T,"TUT.    	King Tut is a name commonly used for the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen. Tutankhamen may not have been the most significant of the pharaohs historically, but he is the most famous today largely because of the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 by Howard Carter.

Tutankhamen's magnificent burial mask is one of the most recognizable of all Egyptian artifacts."
_MA,YMA.    	Yma Sumac was a Peruvian soprano. Sumac had a notable vocal range of five octaves.
ARMA_A,"ARMADA.    	The most famous Armada was the Spanish fleet that sailed against England in order to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I in 1588.

_IG,"AIG.    	AIG is the American International Group, a giant insurance corporation (or I should say, it was). After repeated bailouts by American taxpayers, the company made some serious PR blunders by spending large amounts of money on executive entertainment and middle management rewards. These included a $444,000 California retreat, an $86,000 hunting trip in England, and a $343,000 getaway to a luxury resort in Phoenix. Poor judgment, I'd say ..."

IVA_,"IVAN.    	The Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan IV became known as Ivan the Terrible. The name ""terrible"" is a translation from Russian, and perhaps creates the wrong impression about the man.

OR_Y,"ORLY.    	Orly is on the outskirts of Paris, to the south of the city.

Nena is a German singer (Nena became the name of her band as well), and she had a big hit with one of my favorite songs of the eighties, ""99 Luftballons"" (and the version she recorded in English: ""99 Red Balloons""). The English translation of the German title isn't literal, with the color ""red"" added just so that the title had the right number of syllables. A ""Luftballon"" is the name given to a child's toy balloon in German."
SE_R,"SEER.    	Nostradamus is the Latin name given to the French apothecary and purported seer Michel de Nostredame. His book ""The Prophecies"" is a famous source for predictions of world events.

H_E,"HRE.    	Pepin the Short was the Duke of the Franks from 751 to 768. He expanded the Frankish Empire, and then had to divide it up by law between his two sons, Carloman I and Charlemagne. Carloman I was given lands that were centered around the Paris, and Charlemagne was given lands that completely surrounded his brothers territory.

And it was Charlemagne who in effect founded the Holy Roman Empire."
MG_,"MGM.    	MGM Grand is the name given to a chain of hotel resorts and casinos, most famously the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The MGM Grand Las Vegas was the largest hotel in the world when it opened in 1993, and is now the second-largest (behind the Venetian, also in Las Vegas)."

S_NAR,"SONAR.    	The British developed the first underwater detection system that used sound waves. Research was driven by defence demands during WWI, leading to production of working units in 1922. This new sound detection system was described as using 'supersonics', but for the purpose of secrecy the term was dropped in favor of an acronym. The work was done under the auspices of the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Division, so ASD was combined with the IC from 'superson-ic-s' to create the name ASDIC. The navy even went as far as renaming the quartz material at the heart of the technology 'ASDivite'. By the time WWII came along, the Americans were producing their own systems and coined the term SONAR, playing off the related application, RADAR. And so the name ASDIC was deep-sixed ..."

_UZO,"OUZO.    	Not only was the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" she also wrote the screenplay. The movie never made it to number one at the box office, but still pulled in more money than any other movie not to make it to number one. That record I think reflects that the film wasn't a blockbuster, but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came after the movie, when a spin-off TV show was launched, ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It only ran for 7 episodes."

The areas of the drum exposed to the laser carry a different charge than the unexposed areas. Dry ink (called toner) sticks to the unexposed areas due to electrostatic charge. The toner is then transferred to paper by contact and is fused into the paper by the application of heat. So, that explains why paper coming out of a laser printer is warm, and sometimes powdery ..."

Hobos differed from ""tramps"" and ""bums"", in that ""bums"" refused to work, ""tramps"" worked when they had to, while ""hobos"" traveled in search of work."

By the end of the 18th century the word was being used by students at Cambridge University in England to refer to all local merchants and people of the town. The term evolved to mean one who copies those who are his or her social superior (and not in a good way).

ROU_,"ROUE.    	""Roue"" is a lovely word, I think, describing a less than lovely man. A roue could otherwise be described as a cad, someone of loose morals. ""Roue"" comes from the French word ""rouer"" meaning ""to break on a wheel"". This describes the ancient form of capital punishment where a poor soul was lashed to a wheel and then beaten to death with cudgels and bars. I guess the suggestion is that a roue, with his loose morals, deserves such a punishment."
S_NAR,"SONAR.    	The British developed the first underwater detection system that used sound waves. Research was driven by defence demands during WWI, leading to production of working units in 1922. This new sound detection system was described as using ""supersonics"", but for the purpose of secrecy the term was dropped in favor of an acronym. The work was done under the auspices of the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Division, so ASD was combined with the IC from ""superson-ic-s"" to create the name ASDIC. The navy even went as far as renaming the quartz material at the heart of the technology ""ASDivite"". By the time WWII came along, the Americans were producing their own systems and coined the term SONAR, playing off the related application, RADAR. And so the name ASDIC was deep-sixed ..."
LAN_I,"LANAI.    	Lanai is the sixth largest of the Hawaiian Islands. Lanai was first spotted by Europeans just a few days after Captain Cook was killed on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1779. In 1922, the Hawaiian Pineapple Company bought the whole island of Lanai and turned most of it into the world's largest pineapple plantation. Since then, Lanai has been known as ""The Pineapple Island"". Today, 98% of the island is owned by Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, and 2% is owned by the State of Hawaii."
H_ITI,"HAITI.    	The Caribbean island of Hispaniola was a target for European settlers, and ended up being a disputed territory between France and Spain. The two countries divided the island, with the French taking control of the western third, which they named Saint-Domingue. Saint-Domingue was later to become the independent, and French-speaking, Republic of Haiti."

LUN_,"LUNA.    	Luna Park was the second major amusement park to be opened at Coney Island, accepting its first guests in 1903. ""Luna Park"" gained such a reputation that it lent its name to dozens of amusements parks around the globe, many that still operate today. Although there was a ride called ""A Trip to the Moon"" in the park, with a spacecraft called ""Luna"", the park's name actually came from the sister of one of the designers, Luna Dundy of Des Moines, Iowa."
_UMO,"SUMO.    	Sumo is a sport that is practiced professionally only in Japan, the country of its origin. There is an international federation of sumo wrestling now, and one of the organization's aims is to have the sport accepted as an Olympic event."

_ETI,SETI.    	SETI is the name given to a number of projects that are searching for extraterrestrial life. The acronym stands for 'search for extraterrestrial intelligence'. One of the main SETI activities is the monitoring of electromagnetic radiation (such as radio waves) reaching the Earth in the hope of finding a transmission from a civilization in another world.

G_BI,"GOBI.    	The large desert in Asia called the Gobi lies in northern China and southern Mongolia. The Gobi desert is growing at an alarming rate, particularly towards the south.

TU_,"TUT.    	King Tut is a name commonly used for the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen. Tutankhamen may not have been the most significant of the pharaohs historically, but he is the most famous today largely because of the discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 by Howard Carter. Prior to this find, any Egyptian tombs uncovered by archaeologists had been ravaged by grave robbers. Tutankhamen's magnificent burial mask is one of the most recognizable of all Egyptian artifacts."
