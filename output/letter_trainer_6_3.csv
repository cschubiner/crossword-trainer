Idi Amin received most of his military training in the British armed forces, eventually achieving the highest rank possible for a Black African in the British Colonial Army in 1959, that of Warrant Officer. On his return to Uganda Amin joined his country's military and quickly rose to the rank of Deputy Commander of the Army. During that time he was quite the athlete. He was a noted rugby player and swimmer, and for nine years held the Ugandan national light-heavyweight boxing title. By the early seventies, Amin was commander of all the armed forces of Uganda and in 1971 seized power in a military coup, displacing the country's president Milton Obote. There followed seven years of brutal rule by Amin during which it is estimated that between 100,000 and 500,000 people were murdered. Amin was ousted from power in 1979 after a war with Tanzania, and fled to Libya where he stayed for a year. He then moved to Saudi Arabia, where he was financially supported by the Saudi Royal Family for the remainder of his life. Amin died in 2003."

HAL stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer. Even though, Clarke denied it, there's a good argument that can be made that the acronym HAL is a veiled reference to IBM, the big player in the world of computing at the time of the novel's publication (1968). The acronym HAL is just a one-letter shift from the initials ""IBM""."

_KO,"TKO.    	In boxing (and other sports), a knockout (KO) is when one of the fighters can't get up from the canvas within a specified time, usually 10 seconds. This can be due to fatigue, injury, or the participant may be truly ""knocked out"".

In this case, the bout is said to have been ended by a technical knockout (TKO)."

_LR,"SLR.    	SLR stands for ""single lens reflex"". Usually cameras with changeable lenses are the SLR type. The main feature of an SLR is that a mirror reflects the image seen through the lens out through the viewfinder, so that the photographer sees exactly what the lens sees. The mirror moves out of the way as the picture is taken, and the image that comes through the lens falls onto unexposed film, or nowadays onto a digital sensor."

He has also been called ""A-Fraud"" by teammates because of another perception, that he is over-demanding."
MES_,"MESA.    	The city of Mesa, Arizona is in effect a suburb of Phoenix. The original settlement of non-Native Americans was founded by Daniel Webster Jones who led a Mormon group from St. George, Utah.

CB_,"CBS.    	The first Grammy Awards Ceremony was held in 1959 and focused on recognizing outstanding achievement in the recording industry. The idea of a Grammy Award came up when recording executives were working on the Hollywood Walk of Fame project in the fifties. These executives concluded that there were many people in the recording industry deserving of accolades but who would probably never make it to the Walk of Fame. As a result, they founded the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. The Academy considered naming the award the 'Eddies' after Thomas Edison, but then opted for 'Grammy' after Edison's invention: the gramophone."

TE_,"TEN.    	10 Downing Street is one of the most famous street addresses in the world and is the official London residence of the British Prime Minister. Although it may not look it on television, it's a spacious pad, actually a larger house made by combining three older houses back in the 1700s. Although Number 10 has over one hundred rooms, they are mostly offices and reception rooms and the actual residence itself is quite modest. It was so modest that when Tony Blair came to power he opted to move himself and his family into the more spacious residence next door at Number 11, an apartment traditionally reserved for the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the UK equivalent of the Secretary of the Treasury). The succeeding Prime Minister, David Cameron, seemed to like the idea, because he now lives in Number 11 as well."
CB_,"CBS.    	'Captain Kangaroo' is a TV series for children that CBS aired for a long, long time. The show was first broadcast in 1955, and the last show was aired nearly 30 years later in 1984.

I say, just stay out of the sun ..."
H_N,"HAN.    	Han Solo was the space smuggler in ""Star Wars"" played by Harrison Ford. Ford was originally hired by George Lucas to read lines for actors being cast in ""Star Wars"", and over time Lucas became convinced that Ford was right for the pivotal role of Han Solo."

AM_S,"AMOS.    	""Amos 'n' Andy"" was originally a radio sitcom that was on the air from the twenties right up to the fifties. It was about Amos Jones and Andy Brown, two farm workers from outside Atlanta, who head to Chicago to make good for themselves. They eventually start up the Fresh Air Taxi Company. The show was somewhat groundbreaking for the time, as it depicted African Americans for the first time in positions of influence as business owners. There was a TV adaptation that aired from 1951 to 1953, and in syndication right up to 1966. I have never seen/heard the show, but it sounds like it is a classic ..."
A_LAS,"ATLAS.    	The famous Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator published his first collection of maps in 1578. Mercator's collection contained a frontispiece with an image of Atlas the Titan from Greek mythology holding up the world on his shoulders. That image gave us our term ""atlas""."

The longest entry for one word in the second edition of the OED is the verb ""set"". When the third edition was published in 2007, the longest entry for a single word became the verb ""put"". Perhaps not surprisingly, the most-quoted author in the OED is William Shakespeare, with his most quoted work being 'Hamlet'. The most-quoted female author is George Eliot (aka Mary Ann Evans)."
_TLAS,"ATLAS.    	We call a book of maps an 'atlas' after a collection of maps published by the famous Flemish geographer Gerhadus Mercator.

The film was directed by and stars Ben Affleck and is produced by Grant Heslov and George Clooney, the same pair who produced the excellent 'Good Night, and Good Luck'. I saw 'Argo' when it first came out in theaters and recommend it highly, although I found the scenes of religious fervor to be pretty frightening ..."

S_S,"SYS.    	The Federal Reserve System is more usually known simply as ""the Fed"", and is the central banking system of the US. It was introduced in 1913 in response to a number of financial panics at the beginning of the 20th century. The original role for the Fed was to act as a lender of last resort, in case there was a run on a bank. This can happen as most of the money that is deposited by customers in a bank is reinvested by that bank, so it has very little liquid cash available. If too many customers look for their money at one time, then the bank can be short of cash and this can start a ""run"". The Fed's responsibilities have broadened since those early days ..."
_EN,"TEN.    	The game of ""twenty-one"" was first referred to in a book by Cervantes, the author famous for writing ""Don Quixote"". He called the game ""ventiuna"" (Spanish for ""twenty-one""). Cervantes wrote his story just after the year 1600, so the game has been around at least since then. Twenty-one came to the US but it wasn't all that popular so bonus payments were introduced to create more interest. One of the more attractive bonuses was a ten-to-one payout to a player who was dealt an ace of spades and a black jack. This bonus led to the game adopting the moniker ""Blackjack""."

Back in the mid-1900's the Chero-Cola company, which owned the brand, went for a lightly different twist on ""knee-high"" in advertising. The logo for Nehi was an image of a seated woman's stockinged legs, with her skirt pulled up to her knees, to hint at 'knee-high'."
_LTA,"ALTA.    	Claudia Alta Taylor was named after her mother's brother Claud. But, she had a nurse Alice Tittle who remarked that the little baby was as ""purty as a ladybird"".

AI_A,"AIDA.    	""Aida"" is the famous opera by Giuseppe Verdi, actually based on a scenario written by French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, who also designed the costumes and stages for the opening performance.

DDA_,"D-DAY.    	The most famous D-Day in history was June 6, 1944, the date of the Normandy landings in WWII. The term ""D-Day"" is used by the military to designate the day on which a combat operations are to be launched, especially when the actual date has yet to be determined. What D stands for seems to have been lost in the mists of time although the tradition is that D just stands for ""Day"". In fact, the French have a similar term, ""Jour J"" (Day J), with a similar meaning. We also use H-Hour to denote the hour the attack is to commence."

I_GO,"IAGO.    	Iago is the schemer in Shakespeare's ""Othello"". Iago is a soldier who fought alongside Othello and feels hard done by, missing out on promotion. He hatches a plot designed to discredit his rival Cassio by insinuating that Cassio is having an affair with Desdemona, Othello's wife. By the end of the play it's Iago himself who is discredited and Othello (before committing suicide) apologizes to Cassio for having believed Iago's lies. Heavy stuff ..."
AE_OP,"AESOP.    	Aesop lived in Ancient Greece, probably around the sixth century BC. Supposedly he was born a slave, somehow became a free man, but then met with a sorry end.

_EN,"TEN.    	The fabulous Christmas Carol called 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' dates back at least to 1780 when it was first published in England, though it may be French in origin. The concept of twelve days of Christmas comes from the tradition that the three kings came to visit the Christ Child twelve days after he was born. This same tradition is the origin of the title to Shakespeare's play 'Twelfth Night'."

A_TA,"ALTA.    	Claudia Alta Taylor was named after her mother's brother Claud, but her more familiar name came from her childhood nurse, Alice Tittle, who remarked that as a little baby Claudia was ""purty as a ladybird"". A ladybird is what we call a ladybug on the other side of the Atlantic. So, the moniker Lady Bird stuck with the future First Lady, from when she was just a little one."
M_R,"MIR.    	The Russian Mir Space Station was a remarkably successful project, with the station still holding the record for the longest continuous manned presence in space, at just under ten years. Towards the end of the space station's life however, the years began to take their toll. There was a dangerous fire, multiple system failures, and a collision with a resupply ship. The Russian commitment to the International Space Station drained funds for repairs, so Mir was allowed to reenter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up in 2001."
_ST,"DST.    	On the other side of the Atlantic, Daylight Saving Time (DST) is known as ""summer time"". The idea behind summer/daylight-savings is to move clocks forward an hour in spring (i.e. 'spring forward') and backwards in the fall (i.e. 'fall back') so that afternoons have more daylight."
ALT_,ALTA.    	Alta ski resort actually lies within the Salt Lake City Metropolitan Area.
_VE,"EVE.    	One of my favorite words is ""Aibophobia"", although it doesn't appear in the dictionary and is a joke term. It is a great way to describe a fear of palindromes, by creating a palindrome out of the suffix ""-phobia"". I would call it a ""real"" word though in one sense, as it was introduced in the early eighties and has been around ever since."

This epic poem is divided into 120 sections, each known as a canto."

EV_,"EVE.    	I must confess that I have a problem with movies starring Bette Davis. I think I must have seen her play one of her more sinister roles when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares. So, I have never seen the 1950 classic ""All About Eve"", given that Bette Davis gets top billing. But the title role of Eve Harrington was played by Anne Baxter, and Baxter's movies I do enjoy. Coincidentally, on the epic television series ""Hotel"", when Bette Davis became ill, it was Anne Baxter who was chosen to take over her role."
RI_,"RIA.    	A drowned valley might be called a ria or a fjord. Both are formed as sea level raises and floods the valley. A ria can be confused with a fjord, but the difference is that a ria is a drowned valley created by river erosion, and a fjord is a drowned valley created by glaciation."

Years later the company developed a new brand, Royal Crown Cola (also known as RC Cola).

I_GE,"INGE.    	Playwright William Inge had a run of success on Broadway in the early fifties. Inge's most celebrated work of that time was the play ""Picnic"", for which he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize. The original 1953 cast of ""Picnic"" included a young male actor making his debut on Broadway. His name was Paul Newman. Many of Inge's works are set in the American heartland and so he became known as the 'Playwright of the Midwest'."

Olin had a very successful career in Sweden, often working with the great Ingmar Bergman. Olin's breakthrough international and English-speaking role was playing opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" released in 1988. Way back in 1974, the lovely Miss Olin was crowned Miss Scandinavia in a beauty pageant for Nordic women held in Helsinki, Finland."
_LBA,"ELBA.    	I had a lovely two-week vacation in Tuscany once, including what was supposed to be a two-night stay on Elba.

NP_,"NPR.    	National Public Radio (now just called NPR) was launched in 1970 after President Johnson signed into law the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.

As a longtime fan of the state-funded BBC in the UK, I'd have to agree with that intent ..."

E_M,ELM.    	The Slippery Elm is a species of elm native to North America and is also known as the Red Elm.
_PS,"GPS.    	GPS stands for Global Positioning System. The modern GPS system that we use today was built by the US military who received the massive funding needed because of fears during the Cold War about the use of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. We civilians, all round the world, owe a lot to President Ronald Reagan because he directed the military to make GPS technology available to the public for the common good. He was moved to do so after the Soviet Union shot down KAL flight 007 carrying 269 people, just because the plane strayed accidentally into Soviet airspace."
TE_,"TEN.    	10 Downing Street is one of the most famous street addresses in the world and is the official London residence of the British Prime Minister. Although it may not look it on television, it's a spacious pad, actually a larger house made by combining three older houses back in the 1700s. Although Number 10 has over one hundred rooms, they are mostly offices and reception rooms and the actual residence itself is quite modest. It was so modest that when Tony Blair came to power he opted to move himself and his family into the more spacious residence next door at Number 11, an apartment traditionally reserved for the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the UK equivalent of the Secretary of the Treasury). The succeeding Prime Minister, David Cameron, seemed to like the idea, because he now lives in Number 11 as well."
_ENO,"LENO.    	The so called 'War for Late Night' of 2010 involved Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. O'Brien had stayed loyal to NBC on the understanding that he would take over 'The Tonight Show' after Jay Leno retired. When Leno's contract expired in 2009, NBC moved Leno aside, with his agreement, and O'Brien took over. But Leno then hosted a new spot in prime time called 'The Jay Leno Show', and apparently the two shows split the traditional late night audience, much to the annoyance of advertisers. NBC reacted by moving Leno back to the late night slot, and mayhem ensued!"

UF_,"UFO.    	The famed Area 51 is a remote base in the USAF Nevada Test and Training Range. There's no question that Area 51 is an unusual base in that frontline operational units are not deployed there. It seems that it is used for developing and testing new and classified weapons facilities for the US Military and other US agencies like the CIA. The government did not even acknowledge that Area 51 existed until 1995, and this official position fuelled a theory that the base is home to UFOs that landed on Earth."

ATL_S,"ATLAS.    	We call a book of maps an 'atlas' after a collection of maps published by the famous Flemish geographer Gerhadus Mercator. Mercator's collection contained a frontispiece with an image of Atlas the Titan from Greek mythology holding up the world on his shoulders. That image gave us our term ""atlas""."

Cluedo was the original name of the game, introduced in 1949 by the famous British board game manufacturer Waddingtons. There are cute differences between the US and UK versions. For example, the man who is murdered is called Dr. Black (Mr. Boddy in the US), one of the suspects is the Reverend Green (Mr. Green in the US), and the suspect weapons include a dagger (a knife in the US), a lead pipe (lead piping in the US) and a spanner (a wrench in the US).

The longest entry for one word in the second edition of the OED is the verb ""set"". When the third edition was published in 2007, the longest entry for a single word became the verb ""put"". Perhaps not surprisingly, the most-quoted author in the OED is William Shakespeare, with his most quoted work being 'Hamlet'. The most-quoted female author is George Eliot (aka Mary Ann Evans)."
NAP_,"NAPA.    	Apparently the name ""Napa"" comes from the Native American Patwin word ""napo"" meaning 'house'."
A_NO,"ARNO.    	The Arno is the principal river in the Tuscany region of Italy, passing through the cities of Florence and Pisa. Famously the Arno flooded in 1966, the worst flood in the region for centuries. There were numerous deaths and extensive destruction of priceless art treasures, particularly in Florence."
_PF,"SPF.    	In theory, the Sun Protection Factor, is a calibrated measure of the effectiveness of a sunscreen in protecting the skin from the harmful UV rays of the sun. The idea is that if you wear a lotion with SPF say of 20, then you will need 20 times as much UV radiation to cause the skin to burn with lotion on, than without it. I say, just stay out of the sun ..."
O_NA,"OONA.    	Oona O'Neill dated J. D. Salinger and Orson Welles in her teens, but ended up marrying Charlie Chaplin. She was still pretty young when she married Chaplin, much to the dismay of her famous father, the playwright Eugene O'Neill. After the marriage, Eugene disowned Oona as he was pretty upset that 54-year-old Chaplin could marry his 18-year-old daughter."

I love to travel, and enjoy seeing the teams traverse the globe. The show's host is Phil Keoghan. From his accent, I always thought that Keoghan was from the Boston area. He's actually from New Zealand! Shows you how much I know about American accents ..."
_RS,"ORS.    	Boolean logic is a logic system used in computers. The system takes its name from the man who devised it in 1854, George Boole. Boolean logic is used by many Internet search engines. Using Boolean logic in a search you can combine words into one search term 'like this' by using quotation marks. You can also search for pages that contain 'term one' but NOT 'term two' by searching for 'term one' - 'term two'."
ARN_,"ARNO.    	Pisa is right on the Italian coast, sitting at the mouth of the River Arno, and is famous for its Leaning Tower.

Tom Magliozzi passed away in 2014."

He was tried on a trumped-up charge of stealing from a temple, sentenced to death and was thrown off a cliff."

T_O,"TSO.    	The Taiping Rebellion was a civil war in China that lasted from 1850 to 1864. On one side was the Qing dynasty, and on the other was a Christian movement known as the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace.

O_S,"OAS.    	The Organization of American States (OAS) has its headquarters in Washington, D.C. All the independent states in the Americas are members of the group except Honduras, which had its membership suspended after the country's 2009 coup."

_NGE,"INGE.    	Playwright William Inge had a run of success on Broadway in the early fifties. Inge's most celebrated work of that time was the play 'Picnic', for which he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize. The original 1953 cast of 'Picnic' included a young male actor making his debut on Broadway. His name was Paul Newman. Many of Inge's works are set in the American heartland and so he became known as the 'Playwright of the Midwest'."
P_A,"PGA.    	The Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) was founded in 1916 and today has its headquarters (unsurprisingly) in Florida, where so many golfers live. Back in 1916, the PGA was based in New York City."
_MO,"AMO.    	""Amo, amas, amat' ... ""I love, you love, he/she/it loves"", in Latin."
MA_,"MAO.    	Mao Zedong (also 'Mao Tse-tung') was born on December 16, 1893 in the Hunan Province of China. As Mao was the son of a peasant farmer, his prospects for education were limited. Indeed he left school at age 13 to work on the family farm but did eventually get to secondary school in Changsha, the provincial capital. In the years following, Mao continued his education in Beijing and turned down an opportunity to study in France."
_LR,"SLR.    	SLR stands for ""single lens reflex"". Usually cameras with changeable lenses are the SLR type. The main feature of an SLR is that a mirror reflects the image seen through the lens out through the viewfinder, so that the photographer sees exactly what the lens sees. The mirror moves out of the way as the picture is taken, and the image that comes through the lens falls onto unexposed film, or nowadays onto a digital sensor."
ES_EN,"ESSEN.    	The Ruhr is a large urban area in western Germany. The region is heavily populated, and is the fifth largest urban area in the whole of Europe after Istanbul, Moscow, London and Paris."
N_S,"NAS.    	Rapper Nas used to go by the stage name Nasty Nas, and before that by his real name, Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones. He released ""If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)"" in 1996. Not my cup of tea, I would say ..."
M_S,"MRS.    	Clue is another board game that we knew under a different name growing up in Ireland, as outside of North America Clue is marketed as ""Cluedo"". Cluedo was the original name of the game, introduced in 1949 by the famous British board game manufacturer, Waddingtons. There are cute differences between the US and UK versions. For example, the man who is murdered is called Dr. Black (Mr. Boddy in the US), one of the suspects is the Reverend Green (Mr. Green in the US), the weapons are a dagger (a knife in the US), a lead pipe (lead piping in the US) and a spanner (a wrench in the US). I think it's a fabulous game, a must during the holidays."
_RS,ORS.    	Operating room (OR).
EM_,"EMS.    	In typography, there are em dashes and en dashes. The em dash is about the width of an ""m"" character, and an en dash about half that, the width of an ""n' character. An en dash is used, for example, to separate numbers designating a range, as in 5-10 years. Th em dash seems to be going out of style, and indeed the application I am using to write this paragraph won't let me show you one!"
SAA_,"SAAB.    	SAAB stands for Svenska Aeroplan AB, which translates into English as Swedish Aeroplane Limited. SAAB was, and still is, mainly an aircraft manufacturer. If you take small hops in Europe you might find yourself on a SAAB passenger plane. The SAAB automotive division was acquired by General Motors in the year 2000, who then sold it to a Dutch concern in 2010. However, SAAB (automotive) finally went bankrupt in 2011. A Chinese consortium purchased the assets of SAAB Automotive in 2012, and so SAAB vehicles are in production again. The new vehicles are using the SAAB name, but cannot use the SAAB griffin logo, the rights to which have been retained by the mother company."
_PE,"APE.    	Tarzan' is the title character in the series of books created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The line 'Me Tarzan, you Jane' never appeared in the books, and indeed doesn't even figure in the movies. Apparently Johnny Weissmuller (who played Tarzan in the thirties and forties) saw Maureen O'Sullivan ('Jane', to Weissmuller's 'Tarzan') struggling with a suitcase in the parking lot during filming. He grabbed the bag from her, jokingly saying 'Me Tarzan, you Jane', and people have been quoting those words ever since."
_ORA,"NORA.    	Nora Ephron has many talents, including writing film scripts and novels. Many of the movies that she writes, she also directs. These would include some of my favorite movies of all time like ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""You've Got Mail"" and most recently, the wonderful ""Julie & Julia"". And, did you know that Nora Ephron's second marriage was to journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame?"
A_AI,"ALAI.    	Even though jai alai is often said to be the fastest sport in the world because of the speed of the ball, in fact golf balls usually get going at a greater clip."
_IC,"SIC.    	""Sic"" indicates that a quotation is written as originally found, perhaps including a typo. ""Sic"" is Latin for ""thus, like this"". The term is more completely written as 'sic erat scriptum', which translates as 'thus was it written'."
AM_,"AMP.    	An electric guitar, for example, needs an amplifier to take the weak signal created by the vibration of the strings and turn it into a powerful enough signal for a loudspeaker."
PE_U,"PERU.    	Peru's name comes from the word ""Biru"". Back in the early 1500s, Biru was a ruler living near the Bay of San Miguel in Panama. The territory over which Biru ruled was the furthest land south on the continent known to Europeans at that time. The Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro was the first European to move south of Biru's empire, and the land that he found was designated Peru, a derivative of Biru."
ARC_,ARCO.    	'Arco' is a musical direction instructing a string player to return to normal bowing technique after a passage played using some other technique (perhaps pizzicato).
AR_O,"ARNO.    	The Arno is the principal river in the Tuscany region of Italy, and passes through the cities of Florence and Pisa. Famously, the Arno flooded in 1966, the worst flood in the region for centuries. There were numerous deaths and extensive destruction of priceless art treasures particularly in Florence."
NE_,"NEO-.    	In the art world, 'neorealism' was a movement that started in the early twentieth century, led by two English painters Charles Ginner and Harold Gilman. The neorealists returned to more realistic style after the Romantic Era."
SA_,"SAO.    	The Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe is an island nation off the west coast of Africa comprising mainly two islands: São Tomé and Príncipe. São Tomé and Príncipe is located in the Gulf of Guinea, off the coast of Gabon. It was colonized by Portugal after POrtuguese explorers discovered the islands in the 15th century. After gaining independence in 1975, São Tomé and Príncipe is now the smallest Portuguese-speaking country in the world."

_ZI,"UZI.    	The first Uzi submachine gun was designed in the late 1940s by Major Uziel 'Uzi' Gal of the Israel Defense Forces, who gave his name to the gun."
R_DS,"REDS.    	The Red Scare following WWII had such an effect on the populace that it even caused the Cincinnati baseball team to change its name from the Reds. The team was called the Cincinnati Redlegs from 1953-1958, fearful of losing money due the public distrust of anyone associated with ""Reds""."
AE_OP,"AESOP.    	Aesop lived in Ancient Greece, probably around the sixth century BC. Supposedly he was born a slave, somehow became a free man, but then met with a sorry end. He was sent to the city of Delphi on a diplomatic mission but instead insulted the Delphians. He was tried on a trumped-up charge of stealing from a temple, sentenced to death and was thrown off a cliff."
T_O,"TSO.    	General Tso's chicken is an American creation, often found on the menu of a Chinese restaurant. The name General Tso may be a reference to General Zuo Zongtang of the Qing Dynasty, but there is no clear link."
TE_S,"TESS.    	The full name of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel is ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented"". When it was originally published, ""Tess"" received very mixed reviews, largely because it addressed some difficult sexual themes including rape, and sexual double standards (attitudes towards men vs women). I suppose the most celebrated screen adaption is Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" released in 1979. Polanski apparently made ""Tess"" because his wife, Sharon Tate, gave him Hardy's novel as her last act before she was murdered by the Manson family. There is a dedication at the beginning of the movie that just says ""To Sharon""."
PG_,"PGA.    	The Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) was founded in 1916 and today has its headquarters (unsurprisingly) in Florida, where so many golfers live. Back in 1916, the PGA was based in New York City."
_RNO,"ARNO.    	The Ponte Vecchio is a famous bridge that spans the Arno River in Florence, Italy. The bridge dates back to medieval times, and indeed the name 'Ponte Vecchio' translates as 'Old Bridge'."
TW_,"TWA.    	Trans World Airlines was a big carrier in the US, but was perhaps even more recognized for its extensive presence in Europe and the Middle East. For many years, especially after the collapse of Pan-Am, TWA was considered the unofficial flag carrier for the US. The company started in 1930, the product of a forced merger of Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express. The Transcontinental and Western Air that resulted was what the Postmaster General wanted, a bigger airline to which it could award airmail contracts."
NA_,"NAS.    	Rapper Nas used to go by the stage name Nasty Nas, and before that by his real name, Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones. He released ""Illmatic"", his first album, in 1994. Not my cup of tea, I would say ..."

RE_,"REX.    	In the excellent film ""Toy Story"", Rex is a tyrannosaurus, and a pretty clumsy one. He is voiced by actor Wallace Shawn, whose name is perhaps less familiar than his face. Shawn played the neighbor on ""The Cosby Show"" as well as many, many other supporting roles on TV and the big screen."
A_OD,"A-ROD.    	Poor old Alex Rodriguez earned more nicknames than just A-Rod. He has been called ""the Cooler"" by some players as there is a perception that teams go cold when he joins them, and hot when he leaves. He has also been called ""A-Fraud"" by teammates because of another perception, that he is over-demanding."
S_C,SIC.    	(35A. Backslash neighbor : SQUARE BRACKET)
EL_A,"ELBA.    	I had a lovely two-week vacation in Tuscany once, including what was supposed to be a two-night stay on the island of Elba. I had envisioned Elba as a place full of history, and maybe it is, but it is overrun with tourists who use it as a beach getaway. We left after one day, and we won't be going back."
_TAR,"STAR.    	The game of Scrabble has been produced in many international versions, and each of these editions has its own tile distribution to suit the local language. For example, in English we have two tiles worth ten points: one 'Q' and one 'Z'. If you play the game in French then there are five tiles worth ten points: one 'K', one 'W', one 'X', one 'Y' and one 'Z'."
_LSA,"ILSA.    	Ilsa Lund was of course the role played by Ingrid Bergman in the 1942 movie ""Casablanca"". I love the words of one critic describing the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman in this film: ""she paints his face with her eyes"". Wow ..."
MI_,MIR.    	'Mir' is the Russian word for 'peace'.
IAG_,"IAGO.    	Iago is the schemer in Shakespeare's ""Othello"". Iago is a soldier who fought alongside Othello and feels hard done by, missing out on promotion. He hatches a plot designed to discredit his rival Cassio by insinuating that Cassio is having an affair with Desdemona, Othello's wife. By the end of the play it's Iago himself who is discredited and Othello (before committing suicide) apologizes to Cassio for having believed Iago's lies. Heavy stuff ..."

MI_,"MIR.    	The Russian Mir Space Station was a remarkably successful project, with the station still holding the record for the longest continuous manned presence in space, at just under ten years. Towards the end of the space station's life however, the years began to take their toll. There was a dangerous fire, multiple system failures, and a collision with a resupply ship. The Russian commitment to the International Space Station drained funds for repairs, so Mir was allowed to reenter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up in 2001."
_AS,"NAS.    	Rapper Nas used to go by another stage name, Nasty Nas, and before that by his real name, Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones. Nas released his first album 'Illmatic' in 1994, and inventively titled his fifth studio album 'Stillmatic', released in 2001. Not my cup of tea, I would say ..."

The company started in 1930, the product of a forced merger of Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express.

_ARO,"TARO.    	I am a big fan of starch, and being an Irishman I love potatoes however they are prepared. That said, I think that poi tastes horrible! Poi is made from the bulbous tubers (corm) of the taro plant, by cooking the corm in water and mashing it until the desired consistency is achieved."
ID_,"IDI.    	Idi Amin received most of his military training in the British armed forces, eventually achieving the highest rank possible for a Black African in the British Colonial Army in 1959, that of Warrant Officer. On his return to Uganda Amin joined his country's military and quickly rose to the rank of Deputy Commander of the Army. During that time he was quite the athlete. He was a noted rugby player and swimmer, and for nine years held the Ugandan national light-heavyweight boxing title. By the early seventies, Amin was commander of all the armed forces of Uganda and in 1971 seized power in a military coup, displacing the country's president Milton Obote. There followed seven years of brutal rule by Amin during which it is estimated that between 100,000 and 500,000 people were murdered. Amin was ousted from power in 1979 after a war with Tanzania, and fled to Libya where he stayed for a year. He then moved to Saudi Arabia, where he was financially supported by the Saudi Royal Family for the remainder of his life. Amin died in 2003."
R_BA,"REBA.    	The sitcom ""Reba"" aired for five seasons starting in 2001, a series built around country singer Reba McEntire. The character BJ was played by Melissa Peterman.

_RNO,"ARNO.    	Pisa is right on the Italian coast, sitting at the mouth of the River Arno, and is famous for its Leaning Tower. The tower is actually the campanile (bell tower) of the city's cathedral, and it has been leaning since it was completed in 1173. Just shows you how important good foundations are ..."
_ESOP,"AESOP.    	Our expression 'sour grapes' is an allusion to one of Aesop's fables, the story of 'The Fox and the Grapes'. In the fable, a squirrel could climb up to grapes high in a tree that a fox was unsuccessful in getting to. On seeing this the fox said, 'It's okay, the grapes were sour anyway'."
R_I,"RPI.    	The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is a private school in Troy, New York. The university is named after its founder Stephen Van Rensselaer who set up the school in 1824. The goal of RPI has always been the ""application of science to the common purposes of life"", an objective set by the founder. Given that, the name for the school's sports teams is quite apt, namely 'the Engineers'."
NEA_,"NEAP.    	Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the oceans. At neap tide, the smaller gravitational effect of the sun cancels out some of the moon's effect. At spring tide, the sun and the moon's gravitational forces act in concert causing more extreme movement of the oceans."
HA_,"HAL.    	In Arthur C. Clarke's ""Space Odyssey"" (famously adapted for the big screen as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") the computer system that went rogue was called HAL 9000, or simply ""HAL"". HAL stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer."
S_AR,"STAR.    	The original Macy's store was opened by Rowland Hussey Macy in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1851. This store, and several others that Macy opened, all failed. Macy picked himself up though, and started over again in New York City. Those early New York stores all focused on the sale of dry goods, but added departments quickly as the clientele grew. The Macy's 'star' logo has been around since the company was first established. Macy chose the star because it mimicked the star tattoo that he got as a teenager when he was working on a whaling ship out of Nantucket."
