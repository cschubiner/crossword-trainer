O_ARA,"O'HARA.    	As casting proceeded for the movie version of ""Gone With the Wind"", Clark Gable was a shoo-in from day one. The role of Scarlett was considered very desirable in the acting community, with Bette Davis on the short list, and Katherine Hepburn demanding an appointment with producer David O.

Selznick was adamant though, and stuck by his choice despite a lot of protests."

In 1993, Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords which handed over administration to the Palestinian Authority, but with Israel retaining control of the Gaza Strip's airspace, some land borders and its territorial waters.

Lin was only 21-years-old when she won a public design competition in 1981 to create the memorial. Although her design is very fitting, sadly Lin was not a popular choice for the work given her Asian heritage. As she said herself, she probably would not have been picked had the competition been judged with the knowledge of who was behind each submission."
GE_E,"GENE.    	A gene is a section of a chromosome that is responsible for a particular characteristic in an organism. For example, one gene may determine eye color and another balding pattern. We have two copies of each gene, one from each of our parents, with each copy known as an allele."
_SARS,"TSARS.    	The Grand Prince of Moscow, Ivan IV, became known as Ivan the Terrible. The name ""terrible"" is a translation from Russian, and perhaps creates the wrong impression about the man.

_MINO,"AMINO.    	Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), or now its derivatives, is the ""active"" ingredient in sunscreens in that it absorbs UV radiation.

SHA_,"SHAH.    	The last Shah of Iran was Mohammed-Reza Shah Pahlavi, as he was overthrown in the revolution led by the Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979. The post-revolution government sought the extradition of the Shah back to Iran while he was in the United States seeking medical care (he had cancer).

Some say that this resentment precipitated the storming of the US Embassy in Tehran and the resulting hostage crisis."
_SS,"OSS.    	The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was formed during WWII in order to carry out espionage behind enemy lines.

IB_,"IBM.    	The origin of the IBM nickname ""Big Blue"" seems to have been lost in the mists of time. That said, maybe it has something to do with the fact that the IBM logo is blue, and almost every mainframe they produced was painted blue. I remember visiting IBM on business a few times in my career, and back then we were encouraged to wear white shirts and blue suits to ""fit in"" with our client's culture."
T_J,"TAJ.    	In my mind, the ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"" movies ""let down"" what is a great film tradition. The likes of ""Animal House"" and the ""Vacation"" series were really excellent entertainment, but then someone lost the plot, I guess ..."
AS_N,"ASSN.    	The YMCA is a worldwide movement that has its roots in London, England. There, in 1844, the Young Men's Christian Association was founded with the intent of promoting Christian principles through the development of ""a healthy spirit, mind and body"". The founder, George Williams, saw the need to create YMCA facilities for young men who were flocking to the cities as the Industrial Revolution flourished. He saw that these men were frequenting taverns and brothels, and wanted to offer a more wholesome alternative."

Both ""Hans"" and ""Jean"" translate into English as ""John"". In WWI Arp moved to Switzerland to avoid being called up to fight, taking advantage of Swiss neutrality. Eventually he was told to report to the German Consulate and fill out paperwork for the draft. In order to get out of fighting, Arp messed up the paperwork by writing the date in every blank space on the forms.

AD_,"ADO.    	""Foofaraw"" is excessive or flashy ornamentation, or a fuss over something that is unimportant."
L_D,"LTD.    	In Britain and Ireland the most common type of business (my perception anyway) is one with private shareholders (not publicly traded) and the liability of the shareholders is limited by law to the value of their investment. Such a company is known as a private limited company, and has the letters ""Ltd"" after the name. If the shares are publicly traded, then the company is a public limited company, and has the letter ""plc"" after the name."

IS_A,"ISLA.    	The Balearic Islands ('Baleares' in Spanish) form an archipelago in the western Mediterranean of the east coast of Spain. The Balearics are made up up four main islands: Ibiza and Formentera (aka 'the Pine Islands'), Majorca and Minorca."
ANK_,"ANKA.    	The song 'My Way' has lyrics that were written by Paul Anka in 1969, but the tune itself was composed two years earlier by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. The song had been released with completely different lyrics in France as 'Comme d'habitude' ('As Usual'). When Anka heard the song on television in Paris he sought out and obtained the rights to use it himself, for free. Supposedly, 'Comme d'habitude' has been recorded in more languages, by more artists, than any other song in the contemporary repertoire."
RI_A,"RITA.    	""Lovely Rita"" is a Beatles song on the ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album. When the album was released in 1967, the term ""meter maid"" wasn't used in the UK, although it was a slang term used in the US. The song helped spread the usage of ""meter maid"" all around the English-speaking world. Apparently the inspiration for the song was McCartney getting a parking ticket one day outside the Abbey Road recording studios. He accepted the ticket with good grace, from a warden named Meta Davis. McCartney felt that Meta ""looked like a Rita"", so that was the name she was given in the song."
AS_N,ASSN.    	National Rifle Association (NRA)
_OVA,"NOVA.    	A nova is basically a star that suddenly gets much brighter, gradually returning to its original state weeks or even years later. The increased brightness of a nova is due to increased nuclear activity causing the star to pick up extra hydrogen from a neighboring celestial body. A supernova is very different from a nova. A supernova is a very bright burst of light and energy created when most of the material in a star explodes. The bright burst of a supernova is very short-lived compared to the sustained brightness of a nova."
TS_RS,"TSARS.    	The term czar (also tsar) is a Slavic word that was first used as a title by Simeon I of Bulgaria in 913 AD. ""Czar"" is derived from the word ""Caesar"", which was synonymous with ""emperor"" at that time."

I_M,"IBM.    	The origin of the IBM nickname ""Big Blue"" seems to have been lost in the mists of time. That said, maybe it has something to do with the fact that the IBM logo is blue, and almost every mainframe they produced was painted blue.

_EE,"TEE.    	Tank top' is another one of those terms that always catches me out, as it has a different meaning on each side of the Atlantic. In the US a tank top is a sleeveless shirt, something we would call a 'vest' back in Ireland (and the US 'vest' is what we call a 'waist coat'). A tank top in Ireland is a sleeveless sweater, which further adds to the confusion. The name 'tank top' is derived from 'tank suit', an old name for a woman's one-piece bathing suit.

PH_,"PHI.    	The golden ratio, denoted by the Greek letter phi, is a mathematical constant that often turns up in the world of art. Phi is approximately equal to 1.61, and is represented by the two distances, a and b, where (a+b)/a = a/b. Somehow we perceive the ratio of 1.61 as ""pleasing"" so it appears in many works of art and in building design. For example, many aspects of the Parthenon in Athens have the ratio of 1.61 (width compared to height).

McCartney felt that Meta ""looked like a Rita"", so that was the name she was given in the song."

The building was part of a US$20 billion development of downtown Dubai that was backed by the city government which had to go looking for a bailout from the neighboring city of Abu Dhabi.
