ID on I.R.S.   		3 letters,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although to me, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" these days.

There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax forms who did not actually exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the age of 5 years. Sure enough, in the following year's tax returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation although, given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax returns who did not exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in the following year's returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

Emergency transmission.   		3 letters,"SOS.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
Google executive Schmidt.   		4 letters,"ERIC.    	I used to visit Google a lot when I was in the industry. It is an amazing place, but the culture wouldn't suit an old fogey like me.

Schmidt is now Executive Chairman of the company."

As America Online went international, the acronym AOL was used in order to shake off the ""America-centric"" sound to the name.

"""Free Willy"" creature.   		4 letters","ORCA.    	The orca that starred in the 1993 movie ""Free Willy"" was actually called Keiko, with Willy being his ""stage name"". Keiko had a sad life. He was captured near Iceland in 1979 and sold to a local aquarium. Subsequently he was sold on to Marineland in Ontario, and then Six Flags Mexico in 1985. After starring in the movie, his fans raised money with the intent of returning Keiko to the wild. Keiko had become very ill, partly from being confined in a small tank in Mexico, so a lot of money had to be spent returning him to good health. He was purchased by the Oregon Coast Aquarium who undertook the task of treating him and preparing him for the wild. You might recall the dramatic journey he took from Mexico to Oregon in US Air Force transport plane in 1996. Having regained his health, he was flown to Iceland and there was gradually reintroduced into the wild. Sadly, Keiko did not fare too well back in the ocean. He was never adopted by a pod, so lived a solitary life. He lost weight, would sometimes follow fishing boats and play with any humans who would give him attention. In 2003 he beached himself in Taken Bay in Norway, where he died."

The more correct term then is ""wapiti"", the Shawnee name for the animal, which means ""white rump"". It's all very confusing ..."
