I haven't seen any of them, and have no interest in doing so (despite the excellent cast)."

At it's height, the Mongol Empire stretched from the River Danube to the Sea of Japan."
BERLI_,"BERLIN.    	I once worked for a man who, when serving with the US Army, had the job of filming the construction of the Berlin Wall in the early sixties. Starting in 1952, the border between East And West Germany was strictly controlled, with the help of fences and walls running over 850 miles from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia. There was a big 'gap' in the restrictive barrier, in the divided city of Berlin. Restrictions of movement in between East and West in the city were very lax for most of the fifties (you could take a subway train ""under"" the border, for example), and the Berlin became a gateway for emigration, almost exclusively from East to West. In August 1961, under orders from Nikita Krushchev in Moscow, East Germany closed the border in Berlin, and construction started on the fortified wall."
BAN_AN,"BANYAN.    	The banyan is a fig, and germinates in cracks and crevices of a host tree and then sends roots down towards the ground. The roots that head down the the host give rise to a familiar name for the banyan: the strangler fig."

TWITTE_,"TWITTER.    	I have never tweeted in my life, and have no plans to do so. Twitter is a micro-blogging service that limits the post sent to just 140 characters. In a sense, it is similar to this blog. Here I send out a post once a day containing information that I think might be useful to folks (thank you for reading!). I don't think I could send much of interest using just 140 characters. I believe that many people who do tweet tend to send out messages like ""I'm at dinner now. I am having sushi"" and ""There's nothing on TV. I'm bored"". Nope, I don't think so!"

T_MS,"TAMS.    	A tam o'shanter is a man's cap traditionally worn by Scotsmen. They were originally all blue (and called ""blue bonnets"") but as dyes became more available, they became more colorful.

LIANA_,LIANAS.    	Liana is the name give to vines that generally grow in moist areas such as rain forests. They grow using the trees in the forest as support. My bet is that Tarzan swung from tree to tree on liana vines.

The movie is all about pilots training at the US Navy's Fighter Weapons School. A lot of footage was shot on board the Navy's carrier the USS Enterprise during flight operations. At one point in a day's shooting, the commander of the Enterprise changed course as needed, but this altered the light for the cameras which were filming. Director Tony Scott asked for the course to be changed back, but was informed that a course change cost the Navy $25,000.

SEVE_S,"SEVENS.    	As we all know, the numbers on dice are arranged so that the opposite faces add up to seven. Given this arrangement, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 all meet at a common vertex. Now, there are two ways of arranging the 1, 2 and 3 around the common vertex, a so called right-handed die (clockwise 1-2-3) or a left-handed die (counterclockwise 1-2-3). Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."

HU_S,"HUTS.    	We never used the word ""gridiron"" when I was growing up (meaning a grill used for cooking food over an open fire). So, maybe I am excused for finding out fairly recently that a football field gridiron is so called because the layout of yard lines over the field looks like a gridiron used in cooking!"
CLER_,"CLERK.    	The classic 1843 novella ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens has left us with a few famous phrases and words. Firstly, it led to popular use of the phrase ""Merry Christmas"", and secondly it gave us the word ""scrooge"" meaning a miserly person. And thirdly, everyone knows that Scrooge uttered the words ""Bah! Humbug!""."
BEI_,"BE-IN.    	Just before 1967's Summer of Love in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, a Human Be-In was held in the city's Golden Gate Park.

_ABLE,"GABLE.    	As casting proceeded for the movie version of ""Gone With the Wind"", Clark Gable was a shoo-in from day one. The role of Scarlett was considered very desirable in the acting community, with Bette Davis on the short list, and Katherine Hepburn demanding an appointment with producer David O. Selznick to discuss the role. Vivien Leigh was an unlikely contender, an English actress for the definitive Southern belle role. Selznick was adamant though, and stuck by his choice despite a lot of protests."

_AL,"GAL.    	The term ""do-si-do"" is actually a corruption of a French phrase ""dos- à-dos"", meaning back-to-back. And parenthetically, this is just the opposite to the familiar French term ""vis-à-vis"", meaning face-to-face. In the do-si-do dance move, the partners start facing each other and then advance past each other's right shoulder, and then move to the right without turning so that they are now facing away from each other (back-to-back). They complete the move facing in the same direction, passing each other's left shoulders by moving backwards until they return to the starting position. Did you get that ...?"
ATT_E,"AT THE.    	""Casey at the Bat"" is a poem written in 1888 by Ernest Thayer, first published in the San Francisco Examiner. The poem became very popular due to repeated live performances in vaudeville by DeWolf Hopper. Casey played for the Mudville Nine, and the last line of the poem is ""But there is no joy in Mudville - mighty Casey has struck out."""
OTTAWA_,"OTTAWAN.    	The Senators are the NHL hockey team in Ottawa, Canada. The current team, founded in the 1992-93 season, is the second NHL team in the city to use the name ""Senators"". The original team was founded in 1917, and had a very successful run until the league expanded into the US in the late twenties. The cost of operating in what became the smallest NHL city eventually drove the Senators to St. Louis where they played for a year as the Eagles before finally folding."

A_CS,"ARCS.    	Our modern game of pinball evolved from an earlier table game called bagatelle which used balls, pins and holes (and I remember playing bagatelle as boy in a pub in Ireland). The first 'pinball' machine was made by a British inventor who settled in Cincinnati, Ohio. He modified the game of bagatelle, adding a coiled spring and a plunger to introduce balls at the end of the table, a device that is still in use today. From there manufacturers developed coin-operated versions of pinball, which became popular during the depression as they provided a little entertainment for a few pennies. One distributor of the coin-operated pinball machines started manufacturing them himself as he couldn't source new games fast enough. He called his pinball game Ballyhoo, and eventually named his company Bally, a brand name well known in the gambling industry to this day."

OD_ONS,"ODEONS.    	In Ancient Greece, an odeon was like a small theater, with ""odeon"" literally meaning a ""building for musical competition"". Odea were used in both Greece and Rome, for entertainments such as musical shows and poetry readings."
MADOF_,"MADOFF.    	Bernie Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence for having operated what is described as the largest Ponzi scheme in history. Basically Madoff took investor's money and instead of investing it in the markets as agreed, he put the money into a bank account. He used some of the money he collected from new investors to pay the older investors the anticipated monthly returns. This worked just fine, until too many investors started looking for the return of the original investment. The money was ""gone"", paid to new investors (and Madoff), so the whole scheme collapsed."
GEO_,"GEOG.    	Sporcle.com is a trivia quiz website. The name is derived from the word ""oracle"" apparently. I like the web site's mission statement: ""We actively and methodically search out new and innovative ways to prevent our users from getting any work done whatsoever."""
OCEANI_,"OCEANIA.    	The action in George Orwell's 1949 novel ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" takes place in the intercontinental super-state of Oceania. Orwell created two other super-states, Eurasia and Eastasia."
DR_G,"DRAG.    	The etymology of the term ""drag"", as used in the transvestite world, seems to be unclear. It perhaps relates to the tendency of a transvestite's skirts to drag along the ground in days of old (although why they just didn't hitch up their skirts is beyond me!)."
DENI_O,"DE NIRO.    	The rather disturbing 1996 drama called 'Sleepers' is based on a novel of the same name by Lorenzo Carcaterra. The novel is somewhat autobiographical, telling the story of Carcaterra's incarceration within the New York State penitentiary system, and the effect that this had on his life."

PI_ANHA,"PIRANHA.    	Piranhas are reputed to be able to strip an animal to its bones in seconds, but this is somewhat of a myth. Piranhas are not in fact strict carnivores, and usually are more of a nuisance to fishermen rather than a danger, as they tend to eat bait that has been set to catch other fish. Much of the reputation of the piranha is owed to the description written by President Theodore Roosevelt in his book ""Through the Brazilian Wilderness"". President Roosevelt was somewhat hoodwinked though, as local fishermen put on a special ""show"" for him. They dumped hordes of hungry piranhas into a dammed section of a river and then tossed in a sliced up cow. President Roosevelt was pretty impressed by the orchestrated feeding frenzy."
TEL_VIV,"TEL AVIV.    	The full name of Israel's second largest city is Tel Aviv-Yafo. Tel Aviv translates into ""Spring Mound"", a name chosen in 1910."

The term ""D-Day"" is used by the military to designate the day on which a combat operations are to be launched, especially when the actual date has yet to be determined. What D stands for seems to have been lost in the mists of time although the tradition is that D just stands for ""Day"". In fact, the French have a similar term, ""Jour J"" (Day J), with a similar meaning. We also use H-Hour to denote the hour the attack is to commence."

DNA_EST,"DNA TEST.    	I've always been fascinated by the fact that the DNA of living things is so very similar across different species. Human DNA is almost exactly the same for every individual (to the degree of 99.9%). However, those small differences are sufficient to distinguish one individual from another, and to determine whether or not individuals are close family relations."
STRE_T,"STREET.    	Abbey Road' was the last album that the Beatles released before they finally broke up. ""Abbey Road"" was named after the street in London in which the recording studio was located. The Fab Four is featured in the album's cover, walking across the pedestrian crossing that's in the road right in front of the studio."

ROPEAD_PE,"ROPE-A-DOPE.    	The Rumble in the Jungle was that celebrated fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, broadcast from Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The fight was set in Zaire because of financial arrangements between promoter Don King and Zaire's President Mobutu Seko. ""Rope-a-dope"" was the term coined by Ali to describe his incredibly successful strategy in the contest. From the second round onwards, Ali adopted a protected stance on the ropes, letting Foreman pound him with blows to the body and head, using his arms to take most of the punches. He kept this up until the eighth round, then opened up, and downed the exhausted Foreman with a left-right combination. I hate boxing, but have to say, that was an interesting fight."

He noticed that the seeds of the burdock plant (burrs or burs) stuck to his clothes. Under the microscope he found hooks on the burrs, grabbing hold of loops in his clothing. After years of development, he came up with a way of simulating the natural hook using man-made materials."
CULP_,"CULPA.    	Roman Catholics are very familiar with the Latin phrase ""mea culpa"" meaning ""my fault"", as it is used in the Latin Mass. The additional term ""mea maxima culpa"" would translate as ""my most grievous fault""."
NEFER_ITI,"NEFERTITI.    	Nefertiti was the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten.

ED_FY,"EDIFY.    	'To edify' is to provide instruction in order to improve spiritually, morally or intellectually. The intent is to 'build up' someone's faith or morality and so 'edify' comes from the Latin 'aedificare' meaning 'to build, construct'. This Latin root also gives us our word 'edifice'."
BE_ME,"BEAME.    	Abraham Beame was mayor of New York City from 1974-1977. Beame was actually born in London, England but grew up in New York. His term as mayor was a rough one, as the main focus back then was staving off bankruptcy for the city."

A reporter called Michael Ahern wrote in the 'Chicago Tribune' that the fire was ignited when a cow in the barn kicked over a lantern.

SALIER_,"SALIERI.    	If you've seen the brilliant 1984 movie ""Amadeus"", you'll have seen Salieri portrayed as being very envious and resentful of the gifted Mozart. It is no doubt true that two composers fought against each other, at least on occasion, but the extent of the acrimony between the two has perhaps been exaggerated in the interest of theater. Mozart and his wife had six children, but only two survived infancy. The youngest boy was called Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart, born just five months before his father died. Franz was to become a gifted composer, teacher, pianist and conductor, helped along the way by lessons from his father's supposed rival ... Antonio Salieri."
BU_L,"BULL.    	""Charging Bull"" is a dramatic, bronze statue that sits in Bowling Green Park near Wall Street in New York City. The statue is an example of ""guerrilla art"", as the artist Artura di Modica was not commissioned to create the work, and did so on his own dime. He trucked it over to Broad Street in December 1989 and left it as a Christmas gift to the people of New York. The police seized it, but the public outcry led to the city reinstalling it, in its current location off the street and in the park."
_ARGO,"CARGO.    	""Cargo"" is a Spanish word that we use in English. In Spanish it means ""burden"". The Spanish word in turn comes from the Latin ""carricare"" meaning ""to load onto a cart"". Quite interesting ..."

It was Bailey who negotiated the deal to buy a famous elephant from London Zoo in 1882, the one called ""Jumbo"". It was the exposure that Jumbo got in the circus that brought into common usage our term ""jumbo"" meaning ""huge""."
CHAR_,"CHARD.    	Chard is a lovely leafy vegetable, in my humble opinion. Chard is the same species as the garden beet, but chard is grown for the leaves, and the beet is grown for the roots."
NADI_E,"NADINE.    	Chuck Berry may be a pioneer of rock and roll, but he had an inauspicious start to his life. He was raised in a middle class family in St. Louis, and started playing and performing music in high school. However, while still at school he was arrested and convicted of armed robbery. He served three years for the crime, and was released from prison in 1947 on his 21st birthday. He certainly got his act together after that ..."
HEAR_T,"HEARST.    	William Randolph Hearst got into publishing when he took over 'The San Francisco Examiner' from his father, George Hearst. Beyond his work in the newspaper business, Hearst was also a politician and represented a district of New York in the US House. Hearst's life was the inspiration for the lead role in the 1941 movie 'Citizen Kane' with Orson Welles playing the Hearst-like character. If you're ever driving along the coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco, I'd recommend a stop at Hearst Castle, William Randolph's magnificent estate located near San Simeon."
ORLEA_S,"ORLEANS.    	Joan of Arc led the French Army successfully into battle a number of times during the Hundred Years War with England. When she was eventually captured she was tried in Rouen, the seat of the occupying English government in France at that time. There she was burned at the stake having been found guilty of heresy. Joan of Arc was canonized some 600 years later, in 1920, and is now one of the patron saints of France."
RI_HE,"RICHE.    	A few years ago I had the privilege of living just a short car ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although it has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design. It has a spectacular Roman amphitheater, arch, circus as well as old walls that surround the center of the city. In more modern times, it was a place that Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Cafe Terrace at Night"", as well as ""Bedroom in Arles""."

He journeyed around the Cape of Good Hope, the southernmost tip of Africa, and across the Indian Ocean making landfall in India. Landing in India, his fleet became the first expedition to sail directly from Europe to the sub-continent. Vasco da Gama was well known for acts of cruelty, especially on local inhabitants. One of his milder atrocities was inflicted on a priest that he labelled as a spy. He had the priest's lips and ears cut off, and sent him on his way after having a pair of dog's ears sewn onto his head."
_RGENTINA,"ARGENTINA.    	Pope Francis was elected on 13 March 2013 as the 266th Bishop of Rome and leader of the Roman Catholic church. The new pope appears to be taking a much simpler approach to the office, as he has done with his life back in Argentina. He is the first pope since 1903 not to reside in the papal residence, choosing to live instead to live in the less lavish Vatican guesthouse."
DEANR_SK,"DEAN RUSK.    	Dean Rusk was Secretary of State in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Rusk served for eight years, making him the second-longest serving Secretary of State in US history."
ANA_ROBE,"ANAEROBE.    	Anaerobic organisms are those that do not require oxygen to live. A good example would be the bacteria working away in a septic tank. It's fortunate that these bacteria are anaerobes, otherwise the tank would have to be opened up to the external atmosphere."
_ICARB,"BICARB.    	'Bicarb' is a familiar term for sodium bicarbonate. Another name for the same compound is 'baking soda'. When sodium carbonate is added to a batter, it reacts with acids and releases carbon dioxide which gives baked goods texture, all those ""holes""."

ASE_UAL,"ASEXUAL.    	Asexual reproduction differs from sexual reproduction in that only one parent is involved. Asexual reproduction is common among simpler organisms and some plants and fungi. Asexual reproduction is thought be useful in providing a rapid growth of a population, whereas sexual reproduction has the advantage of creating genetic diversity, hence improving the chances of adaptation to a changing environment."
CASA_,"CASAS.    	Adobe has been around a long time, and has been used in dry climates all over the world. The original form of the word ""adobe"" dates back to Middle Egyptian times, about 2000 BC. The original ""spelling"" is dj-b-t, and translates as mud (sun-dried) brick."

_LARK,"CLARK.    	Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were soldiers in the US Army. Lewis was a personal aide to President Thomas Jefferson, even residing in the Presidential Mansion.

Lewis asked Clark to come out of retirement to accompany him on his three-year exploration."

CHAD_,"CHADS.    	We are all familiar with ""hanging chads"" after the famous Florida election recounts of 2000. A chad is any piece of paper punched out from a larger sheet. So, those round bits of paper we've all dropped over the floor when emptying a hole punch, they're chads."
SEXP_STOLS,"SEX PISTOLS.    	The Sex Pistols were the group that introduced the punk movement to the UK, back in 1975. They were very vocal in their opposition to the social norms of the time. One of their most famous singles is 'God Save the Queen', from 1977. The words were considered so offensive that workers at the plant where the record was being pressed came out on strike rather than be associated with the song. When it was eventually released, the BBC went as far as banning the record, not something that happens very often."
FEDORA_,"FEDORAS.    	A fedora is a lovely hat, I think. It is made of felt and is similar to a trilby, but has a broader brim. ""Fedora"" was a play written for Sarah Bernhardt and first performed in 1889. Bernhardt had the title role of Princess Fedora, and on stage she wore a hat similar to the modern-day fedora. The play led to the introduction of a women's fashion accessory, the fedora hat, commonly worn by women into the beginning of the twentieth century. Men then started wearing fedoras, but only when women gave up the idea ..."

_SOFA,"US OF A.    	The first person to coin the phrase ""Old Glory"" with reference to the American flag was Captain William Driver, a ship master from Salem, Massachusetts. As he was leaving on an 1831 voyage aboard the brig Charles Doggett, he unfurled the American flag that he had just been given by a group of friends. As the flag caught the breeze he uttered the words, ""Old Glory!"". That's the story anyway. By the way, on that same voyage, Captain Driver rescued the famous mutineers of the HMS Bounty, when he found them on Pitcairn Island."

SOAPOP_RA,"SOAP OPERA.    	As almost everyone knows, the original soap operas were radio dramas back in the fifties. Given the structure of society back then, the daytime broadcasts were aimed at housewives working in the home. For some reason the sponsors of those radio shows, and the television shows that followed, were soap manufacturers like Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Lever Brothers. And that's how the ""soap"" opera got its name ..."
_PEX,"APEX.    	The nadir is the direction pointing immediately below a particular location (through to the other side of the Earth for example). The opposite direction, that pointing immediately above, is called the zenith."

TO_R,"TOUR.    	Some helpful blog readers have educated me on the term ""Realtor"" and have pointed out why the word is capitalized. ""Real estate agent"" is a general, generic term. ""Realtor"" is the name given to a member of the trade association known as the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The NAR has gone so far as the trademark the term ""Realtor"" in the US."
_HEY,"THE Y.    	The YMCA is a worldwide movement that has its roots in London, England. There, in 1844, the Young Men's Christian Association was founded with the intent of promoting Christian principles through the development of ""a healthy spirit, mind and body"".

'Phishing' is a variant of the word ""fishing', as in 'fishing for passwords, PIN numbers etc."""
GEN_I,"GENII.    	I think there might be a mistake here, as 'genii' is the plural of 'genius', and not of 'genie'. Although the two terms are related historically (see below), I think that's all in the past ..."
C_PES,"CAPES.    	""Dracula"" is a novel written by the Irish author Bram Stoker, and first published in 1897.

B_OMES,"BIOMES.    	I tend to think of ""biome"" is another word for ecosystem."
C_OMO,"CUOMO.    	Mario Cuomo was Governor of New York from 1983 to 1994. I well remember Mario Cuomo's keynote address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention soon after I moved to America. For a new immigrant it was an interesting glimpse into American politics. Here's a little bit of trivia about Mario Cuomo: he was the first ever guest for Larry King on his CNN talk show 'Larry King Live', back in 1985."
KIT_D,"KITED.    	Check kiting is illegal. The idea behind kiting is to write a check, even though there are insufficient funds to cover the amount. Then, the con artist writes another check, also with insufficient funds, from another bank's account to cover the original check. I am not sure it would work nowadays, but then again, I am as honest as the day is long! Oh, and I think the term ""kiting"" comes from the older phrase ""go fly a kite"", the idea being that the bad check is floated on air (non-existent funds)."

L_ANAS,LIANAS.    	Liana is the name give to vines that generally grow in moist areas such as rain forests. They grow using the trees in the forest as structural support. My bet is that Tarzan swung from tree to tree on liana vines ...
BON_,"BONG.    	Big Ben is the name commonly used for the large bell in the Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster (aka the Houses of Parliament). Big Ben's official name is the Great Bell, and there is some debate about the origins of the nickname.

VO_E,"VOTE.    	The 19th Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits the denial of voting rights to citizens based on sex, and was ratified by the states in 1920.

RI_AS,"RITAS.    	""Lovely Rita"" is a Beatles song on the ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album. When the album was released in 1967, the term ""meter maid"" wasn't used in the UK, although it was a slang term used in the US. The song helped spread the usage of ""meter maid"" all around the English-speaking world. Apparently the inspiration for the song was McCartney getting a parking ticket one day outside the Abbey Road Studios. He accepted the ticket with good grace, from a warden named Meta Davis. McCartney felt that Meta ""looked like a Rita"", so that was the name she was given in the song."
TI_,TIX.    	One buys tickets at the box office.
ABETT_D,"ABETTED.    	The word ""abet"" comes into English from the Old French ""abeter"" meaning ""to bait"" or ""to harass with dogs"" (it literally means ""to make bite"").

AN_OLA,"ANGOLA.    	Angola is a country in south-central Africa, on the west coast. Angola is the fourth largest diamond exporter in Africa, after Botswana, the Congo and South Africa.

O_EARY,"O'LEARY.    	The Great Chicago Fire blazed for almost three full days in October of 1871. By the time it was extinguished hundreds of people had died and four square miles of the city had been destroyed. It is known that the fire started in or near a small barn owned by an Irish immigrant, a Mrs. Catherine O'Leary. A reporter called Michael Ahern wrote in the 'Chicago Tribune' that the fire was ignited when a cow in the barn kicked over a lantern. Years later, Ahern admitted that he made up the story about the cow and the lantern, as he felt it made colorful copy. Supposedly Mrs. O'Leary died a heart-broken woman as she spent the rest of her life with the public blaming her on the tragic loss of life and property."

There's a story that Mets center fielder Richie Ashburn was always running into Elio Chacon in the outfield, because he would call for the ball in English, and Chacon only understood Spanish. Ashburn started to call for the ball in Spanish ""Yo la tengo!"" (I've got it!), at which point he kept getting run down by left fielder Frank Thomas who only understood English ..."
