Rather it is a piece of music with an ""improvisatory feel"", a piece that seems very spontaneous in form."
T_YCAR,"TOY CAR.    	The brand name Matchbox toy cars were introduced in 1953, and how I loved them growing up.

RE_L,"REEL.    	A haymaker is a wide, swinging punch. It is so called because the action involves using one's weight and shoulder power to deliver the blow, with a motion much like using a scythe to cut hay."
MON_H,"MONTH.    	I still have trouble with this one. Where I come from, the 6 is the day and the 8 the month."
S_AP,SOAP.    	'All My Children' was the first daytime soap opera to debut in the seventies. Star of the show was Susan Lucci who played Erica Kane. The show was cancelled in 2011 after having being on the air for 41 years.
NE_,"NEG.    	The most important grouping of blood types is the ABO system. Blood is classified as either A, B, AB or O, depending on the type of antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. A secondary designation of blood is the Rh factor, in which other antigens are labelled as either positive or negative. When a patient receives a blood transfusion, ideally the donor blood should be the same type as that of the recipient, as incompatible blood cells can be rejected. However, blood type O-neg can be accepted by recipients with all blood types, A, B, AB or O, and positive or negative. Hence someone with O-neg blood type is called a 'universal donor'."
ANTO_IO,"ANTONIO.    	Famously, at the climax of William Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"", Antonio goes on trial because he cannot repay a loan to Shylock of 3,000 ducats. Faced with non-payment, Shylock demands his legal right to ""a pound of flesh""."
CO_L,"COAL.    	Apparently, the tradition of putting coal in the Christmas stocking of a poorly-behaved child comes simply from the proximity of the stocking (hanging on the fireplace) to a source of coal!"
_OB,"MOB.    	In the world of retail, 'Black Friday' is the day after Thanksgiving in the US. Black Friday is when many stores start the holiday shopping season, and so offer deep discounts to get ahead of the competition."
ALICI_,"ALICIA.    	Alicia Keys is the stage name of Alicia Cook, an R&B and soul singer from Hell's Kitchen in New York City."
_KEEFE,O'KEEFE.    	Michael O'Keefe played Danny Noonan in the film 'Caddyshack' (I'm not a big fan of that movie). I also saw O'Keefe not that long ago in the George Clooney film 'Michael Clayton'.
R_MP,"RCMP.    	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the Mounties; RCMP) is unusual in that it provides all policing for the whole country. It works on the national level, right down to the municipal level. Dudley Do-Right appeared on the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, a cartoon that appeared on television in a couple of different versions from 1959-1964. Dudley was a bungling Mountie who struggled with his nemesis, the evil Snidely Whiplash."

That said, there are relatively few two-dollar bills in circulation. Some people even hold that possession of a two-dollar bill is bad luck."
AI_GE,"AINGE.    	Danny Ainge is a retired professional basketball and baseball player, now serving as the President of Basketball Operations for the Boston Celtics.

SE_ORA,"SENORA.    	Lima is the capital city of Peru. Lima was founded in 1535 by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro, who named it 'la Ciudad de los Reyes' (the City of Kings). He chose this name because the decision to found the city was made on January 6th, the feast of the Epiphany that commemorates the visit of the three kings to Jesus in Bethlehem."
AD_MSALE,"ADAM'S ALE.    	I suppose water was all that Adam had available to him to drink, so that's how the expression Adam's ale arose (I am guessing ... can't find anything definitive anywhere). It makes a nice juxtaposition with ""the demon drink""!"
AP_IL,"APRIL.    	Earth Day started out in the US, an event introduced by Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. Earth Day was designed to increase awareness and appreciation of the Earth's natural environment. The original Earth Day was on April 22nd, 1970. Decades later, the day is observed in over 175 countries."
_APS,"MAPS.    	The famous Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator published his first collection of maps in 1578. Mercator's collection contained a frontispiece with an image of Atlas the Titan from Greek mythology holding up the world on his shoulders. That image gave us our term ""atlas""."

_UVS,"SUVS.    	'SUV' is an initialism standing for Sports Utility Vehicle, and is a term that was introduced by our marketing friends. Using the term Sports Utility Vehicle was a very clever way to get us to pay a lot of money for what was essentially a station wagon on a truck chassis, or at least it was back then."
LI_HO,"LITHO.    	Lithography is a printing technique that was invented in 1796 as a cheap way to publish theatrical works. The method involves the image being drawn, usually on a metal plate but originally on a stone (hence the prefix ""litho-""). The image is drawn in such a way that some regions of the plate repel ink, so when paper is applied to the plate, those areas are ink-free."
TH_SE,"THESE.    	""These Eyes"" was a 1969 hit for the Canadian rock band, the Guess Who."
_RIP,"CRIP.    	The Crips are a street gang here in the US, with origins in Los Angeles going back to 1969.

The weapon is usually associated with gauchos, the South American cowboys, although there is evidence that the Inca army used them in battle."

A local paper was asked to run a competition to suggest names for the new team and the community came up with its four top picks of 'Heat', 'Tropics', 'Juice' and 'Magic'. A committee then opted for 'Orlando Magic'. A good choice I think ..."
MA_HU,"MACHU.    	Machu Picchu is known as 'The Lost City of the Incas', and it can be visited on a mountain ridge in Peru, 50 miles northwest of the city of Cuzco in the southeast of the country. The name Machu Picchu means 'old peak'. The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu originates about 50 miles from Cusco on the Urubamba River in Peru. It can take travelers about 5 days to trek the full length of the trail, passing through many Incan ruins before reaching the Sun Gate on Machu Picchu mountain.

FO_E,"FORE.    	No one seems to know for sure where the term ""fore!"" comes from. It has been used at least as far back as 1881, and has always been called out to warn other golfers that a wayward ball might beheading their way. My favorite possibility for its origin is that it is a contraction of the Gaelic warning cry ""Faugh a Ballach!"" (clear the way!) which is still called out in the sport of road bowling, a game where players bowl balls along roads between villages, trying to do reach the end of the course in as few bowls as possible, just like in golf!"
D_EEB,"DWEEB.    	Dweeb is relatively recent American slang that came out of college life in the late sixties. Dweeb, squarepants, nerd: they're all are not-so-nice terms that mean the same thing, someone excessively studious and socially inept."
AREND_,"ARENDT.    	Hannah Arendt was studying and working the field of philosophy, when she had to flee her native Germany in the run up to WWII because of her Jewish heritage. She ended up in the US in 1941, and took posts in various schools here.

G_P,"GYP.    	""Gyp"" is American SLANG (43 across) meaining ""cheat"". It dates back to the late 1800's and may derive from the word ""gypsy""."

_CR,VCR.    	Video Cassette Recorder (VCR)
_TVS,ATVS.    	All-terrain vehicle (ATV)
E_EI,ERE I.    	The three most famous palindromes in English are:
MA_S,"MAPS.    	Rand McNally is a company long associated with the city of Chicago. Its roots go back to 1856 when William Rand opened a printing shop in the city. Two years later he hired an Irish immigrant named Andrew McNally and the pair turned to printing tickets and timetables for the railroad industry. They diversified into ""railroad guides"" in 1870, a precursor of what was to be their big success, the road atlas. When automobile travel started to become significant, Rand and McNally turned their attention to roads and they published their first road map, of New York City in 1904. Rand and McNally really popularized the use of highway numbers, and indeed erected many roadside highway signs themselves, long before the state and federal authorities adopted the idea."

And in 2004, he collaborated with his sister Pat Koch, and wrote a children's book called ""Eddie, Harold's Little Brother"", a tale about Ed's own childhood experiences."
A_ZIO,"ANZIO.    	The WWII Battle of Anzio is famous for being one of the most terrible blunders in military history. Operation Shingle was a surprise amphibious landing at Anzio, 35 miles south of Rome, designed to outflank the Germans and press home an attack on the Italian capital. The element of surprise allowed a safe landing at Anzio, and the allies were able to drive jeeps right into the outskirts of Rome unchallenged. But that element of surprise was lost when Allied commander General John Lucas decided to delay the march on Rome until he had consolidated his position on the beaches, a position that was surrounded by high ground. The Germans used the delay to throw everything they had into the high ground and the allies were pinned down in a bloody battle. As a result, it took four months for the allies to fight their way inland."
OCT_NE,"OCTANE.    	The difference between a a premium and regular gasoline rating is its octane rating. The octane rating is measure of the resistance to the gasoline to auto-igniting, it's resistance to igniting just by virtue of being compressed in the cylinder. This auto-ignition is undesirable, as multiple-cylinder engines are designed so that ignition within each cylinder takes place precisely when the plug sparks, and not before. When ignition occurs before the spark is created, the phenomenon created is called ""knocking""."
IPO_NANO,"IPOD NANO.    	The iPod Nano is the successor to the iPod Mini and was introduced to the market at the end of 2005.

According to co-star Jamie Lee Curtis, Ameche went around the set before the scene was shot, and apologized in advance to everyone for having to use bad language."

_AN,"VAN.    	Van Camp's is the second-most popular brand of canned beans in the US, after Bush's. The brand name originated with Gilbert Van Camp in 1861."
ELM_RE,"ELMORE.    	Elmore Leonard used to write a lot of westerns in the fifties and moved onto crime and suspense novels later in his career. A lot of Leonard's books have made it to the big screen, including 'Get Shorty' and 'Mr Majestyk'."
EST_NIA,"ESTONIA.    	The main feature of the Skype application is that it allows voice communication to take place over the Internet (aka VoIP). It has other features such as video conferencing and instant messaging, but it made its name from voice communication. Skype was founded by two Scandinavian entrepreneurs and the software necessary was developed by a team of engineers in Estonia. The development project was originally called ""Sky peer-to-peer"" which gave birth to the name Skyper, which had to be shortened to Skype because the skyper.com domain name was already in use."
ARTIS_,"ARTIST.    	iTunes is a very, very successful software application from Apple. It's basically a media player that works on platforms like the iPad, iPhone and iPod. Of course it connects seamlessly to the iTunes store, where you can spend all kinds of money."

C_IBS,"CRIBS.    	I think the idea here is that some baby cribs are small and portable, but I could be wrong!"
I_O,"IVO.    	Ivo Pogorelich is a classical pianist from Croatia. After his wife died in 1996, Pogorelich stopped performing for many years, instead devoting himself to the design of jewelry!"
_WAHILI,"SWAHILI.    	Swahili is indeed a widespread language in Africa, but only 5-10 million people speak it as their native language. It is more commonly spoken though as it is also the national, official language of at least four countries: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. So, within much of East Africa, Swahili is often spoken as the common language (lingua franca) between people who have different native tongues."
_EDD,"REDD.    	Redd Foxx was the stage name of John Elroy Sanford, best known for starring in ""Sanford and Son"". ""Sanford and Son"" was an American version of a celebrated hit BBC sitcom that I grew up with in Ireland, called ""Steptoe and Son""."
PRA_A,"PRADA.    	Prada was started in 1913 as a leathergoods shop in Milan, by the two Prada brothers. One of the brothers, Mario Prada, prevented the female members of his family participating in the company as he didn't believe women should be involved in business (!). When the sexist brother died, his son had no interest in the business so it was his daughter who took over and ran the company for about twenty years, handing it over to her own daughter. I'd say the devil loved that ..."
SLOT_S,"SLOTHS.    	""Sloth"", meaning ""indolence, sluggishness"", came from the Middle English word ""slowe"", the same root for our contemporary word ""slow"". The animal, the sloth, is named for its slow-moving behavior."
_IELD,"YIELD.    	In the imperial system of weights and measures, a bushel is a unit of dry volume made up of 4 pecks. In the US system, a bushel is a dry volume of 8 gallons. We have used the term 'bushel' to mean 'large quantity' since the 14th century."
E_OTE,"EMOTE.    	The word ""ham"", describing a performer who overacts, is apparently a shortened form of ""hamfatter"" and dates back to the late 1800s. ""Hamfatter"" comes from a song in old minstrel shows called ""The Ham-Fat Man"". It seems that a poorly performing actor was deemed to have the ""acting"" qualities of a minstrel made up in blackface."
APRO_,APRON.    	The apron of a stage (if it has one) is that part which projects out into the audience.
_PICEGIRLS,"SPICE GIRLS.    	Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton, and my fave!), Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell), Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham) and Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm)."
SKO_,SKOR.    	Skor is a candy bar produced by Hershey's. Skor is sold in Canada as Rutnam.
U_EES,"ULEE'S.    	""Ulee's Gold"" is a highly respected film from 1997 in which Peter Fonda plays the title role of Ulee. Ulee's ""gold"" is the honey that Ulee produces. It is a favorite role for Peter Fonda and he has shared that playing Ulee brought to mind his father Henry Fonda, who himself kept a couple of hives.

_OPEKA,"TOPEKA.    	Topeka is the capital of Kansas, and is located on the Kansas River in the northeast of the state. The name 'Topeka' was chosen in 1855 and translates from the Kansa and the Ioway languages as 'to dig good potatoes'.

A_RS,ARRS.    	Arrival (arr.)
SPIRE_,"SPIREA.    	The shrub spirea is used medicinally by Native Americans in particular, taken as a herbal tea. The main medicinal ingredient is methyl salicylate, an aspirin-like compound."

He was presented with a replacement medal during those 1996 Games."
Z_LCH,"ZILCH.    	We use the term 'zilch' to mean 'nothing'. Our current usage evolved in the sixties, before which the term was used to describe 'meaningless speech'. There was a comic character called Mr. Zilch in the 1930s in 'Ballyhoo' magazine. Mr. Zilch's name probably came from the American college slang 'Joe Zilch' that was used in the early 1900s for 'an insignificant person'."
_OGEY,"BOGEY.    	The term ""Bogey"" originated at the Great Yarmouth Golf Club in England in 1890, and was used to indicate a total round that was one over par (and not one over par on a particular hole, as it is today). The name Bogey came from a music hall song of the time ""Here Comes the Bogey Man"". In the following years it became popular for players trying to stay at par to be ""playing against Colonel Bogey"". Then, during WWI, the marching tune ""Colonel Bogey"" was written and named after the golfing term. If you don't recognize the name of the tune, it's the one that's whistled by the soldiers marching in the great movie ""The Bridge on the River Kwai""."
DI_,"DIF.    	How would you distinguish them? What's the difference (""dif"")?"
TIO_,"TIOS.    	The official name of Uruguay is the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, reflecting the country's location on the eastern coast of South America.

BR_C,"BRIC.    	Bric-a-brac was a French phrase that was used as far back as the 16th century, but is no longer used in France. Back then it was a nonsense term meaning ""at random"" or ""any old way"". Since Victorian times we have used the phrase in English to mean a collection of curios, statues and the like. Unlike back then, in modern usage bric-a-brac tends to be a selection of cheaper items."
