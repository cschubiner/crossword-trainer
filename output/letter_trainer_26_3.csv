The ""rotating rooter"" snaked down the sewer line, and rotating blades at the tip of the cable cut through the troublesome roots. Blanc sold his machine for decades to people who set up their own drain clearing businesses. In 1980 the Blanc family sold the Roto-Rooter company to a Cincinnati concern that started buying up independent franchises that used the Roto-Rooter to create the national service with which we are familiar today.

The term evolved to mean one who copies those who are his or her social superior (and not in a good way).

Nowadays a snob is anyone who looks down on those considered to be of inferior standing."

He needed money for booze one weekend and so sold the watch to my Dad, for five pounds. My Dad gave it to me just before he died, as he knew I loved the watch, and my brothers weren't interested in it all. Not so long ago I had the watch appraised ($3,000), and my brothers suddenly took a liking to it! Still, it's not something that will ever be sold, that's for sure ..."

There's an oft-quoted story that James Cook (later Captain Cook) asked a local native the name of this remarkable looking animal, and the native responded with 'kangaroo'.

ANOD_S,"ANODES.    	A battery is a device that converts chemical energy into electric energy. A simple battery is made up of three parts: a cathode, an anode and a liquid electrolyte. Ions from the electrolyte react chemically with the material in the anode producing a compound and releasing electrons. At the same time, the electrolyte reacts with the material in the cathode, absorbing electrons and producing a different chemical compound. In this way, there is a buildup of electrons at the anode and a deficit of electrons at the cathode. When a connection (wire, say) is made between the cathode and anode, electrons flow through the resulting circuit from the anode to cathode in an attempt to rectify the electron imbalance."

_SCAPE,"ESCAPE.    	Harry Houdini was the stage name of Hungarian-born escapologist and magician Erik Weisz (later changed to 'Harry Weiss'). Many people are under the impression that Houdini died while performing an escape that went wrong, an impression created by the storyline in a couple of movies about his life. The truth is that he died of peritonitis from a burst appendix. It is also true that a few days prior to his death Houdini took a series of punches to his stomach as part of his act, but doctors believe that his appendix would have burst regardless."

TYL_R,"TYLER.    	John Tyler was the tenth President of the US, and the first to take the office on the death of the incumbent. Tyler's predecessor was President William Henry Harrison, who was in office only 32 days before he died of natural causes. For a while there was a little confusion about the wording in the constitution that covered such an eventuality. There was an argument made that Tyler would continue as Vice-President but would assume the responsibilities of the office of President, in effect as 'Acting President'. However, Tyler proceeded as though he was taking over as President and took the oath of office in his hotel room in Washington. Soon afterwards, Congress declared that Tyler was indeed President, although many continued to dispute the fact. Many of President Tyler's opponents referred to him as 'His Accidency'."

JAME_,JAMES.    	We have had more US presidents with the given name 'James' than any other. There have been six:
P_IX,"PRIX.    	Even though the term is used in many competitions, I think that we most associate 'Grand Prix' with the series of Formula One motor races. These Formula One Grand Prix races trace their roots back to organized automobile road races from one French town to the next that date back to 1894. 'Grand Prix' translates from French as 'grand, big prize.'"
_AIDER,"RAIDER.    	The Oakland Raiders football team was founded in 1960, and was originally intended to play in Minnesota. Instead, the team played in Oakland from 1960 to 1981 and then spent 12 years in Los Angeles before returning to Oakland in 1995."

The equivalent command for a right turn is ""Gee!"" Just to confuse things, the same commands are used in the British Isles but with the opposite meanings. That must be pretty unsettling for jet-setting plow horses ..."

_UA,QUA.    	'Qua' is a preposition meaning 'in the capacity of'. 'Qua' is a form of the Latin word for 'who'.

Independence is celebrated on September 16, whereas Cinco de Mayo is of course celebrated on May 5th. Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Mexican victory over the French at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862."
BA_R,"BAER.    	Max Baer was an American Heavyweight Champion of the World in the thirties. Baer held the title for 364 days, and then went into the ring after hardly training at all against the well-prepared James J. Braddock. Braddock was a huge underdog, and yet emerged victorious after 15 rounds (Braddock is the subject of the 2005 movie ""Cinderella Man"").

KON_,"KONG.    	King Kong' really is a classic movie. It stars Fay Wray as the young woman (name Ann Darrow) with whom Kong falls in love.

At least that's how the story goes ..."
PIT_S,"PITAS.    	Pita is a lovely bread in Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. Pita is usually round, and has a ""pocket"" in the center.

The cape was dropped in the 20th century, and now an Ulster a relatively simple, hard-wearing, double-breasted overcoat."
JAG_,"JAGS.    	Jaguar started out as a manufacturer of sidecars for motorcycles back in 1922, when the company was known as the Swallow Sidecar Company (SS for short).

PTB_AT,"PT BOAT.    	PT boats were motor torpedo boats: small speedy vessels that used torpedoes as their primary weapon against large surface ships. The ""PT"" stands for ""Patrol Torpedo"".

SM_OT,"SMOOT.    	The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was sponsored by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley. The act raised tariffs on imported goods to record levels, the second highest in US history. The strategy appeared to work at first, protecting US jobs in the early days of the depression. But as many anticipated, tariffs were raised in retaliation by other countries and US exports plummeted. Many economists blame the 1930 Tariff Act for the depth of the Great Depression."
_ATE,"GATE.    	The term ""box office"" may date back to Shakespearean times. In those days long past, patrons would deposit fees for seeing theater performances in boxes. The full boxes would be collected and placed in an office called, imaginatively enough, the ""box office""."

Later she took over as star of the show ""8 Simple Rules"" in the middle of its run, when John Ritter passed away unexpectedly in 2003.

LA_LA,"LAYLA.    	""Layla"" is one of the great rock anthems of the seventies, released by Derek and the Dominos in December of 1970. It is a masterpiece of composition, with the first half of the song a great vehicle for the guitar-playing talents of Eric Clapton.

To top things off we have the ""unplugged"" version recorded by Clapton in 1992, a fabulous and inventive variation on the original."

PA_A,"PABA.    	Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), or now its derivatives, is the ""active"" ingredient in sunscreens in that it absorbs UV radiation. PABA derivatives are used today as PABA itself fell out of favor due to its tendency to stain clothes and to cause an allergic reaction in some users."
T_ON,"-TRON.    	A JumboTron is a big-screen television system from Sony, often seen in sports stadiums. The brand name 'JumboTron' is used pretty generically now for any big-screen system in such venues, even though Sony exited the business in 2001."

SO_P,"SOAP.    	As almost everyone knows, the original soap operas were radio dramas back in the fifties. Given the structure of society back then, the daytime broadcasts were aimed at housewives working in the home. For some reason the sponsors of those radio shows, and the television shows that followed, were soap manufacturers like Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Lever Brothers. And that's how the ""soap"" opera got its name ..."
B_L,"BIL.    	Bil Keane is a cartoonist most associated with his strip 'The Family Circus'.

BLI_,"BLIP.    	Scientists have been using radio waves to detect the presence of objects since the late 1800s, but it was the demands of WWII that accelerated the practical application of the technology.

I had the privilege of visiting the city some years ago, and I can attest that it is indeed spectacular ..."
HECKL_,"HECKLE.    	The original use of the verb ""to heckle"" was to mean questioning severely, and for many years was associated with the public questioning of parliamentary candidates in Scotland.

A nemesis is often someone one cannot seem to beat in competition."
STROH_,"STROH'S.    	Bernard Stroh was the son of a German brewer. He immigrated to the US in 1848, and set up his own brewery in 1850, in Detroit. Years later, the Stroh Brewing Company introduced a European process called fire-brewing. This results in higher temperatures at a crucial stage in the brewing process, supposedly bringing out flavor. Stroh's is the only American beer that still uses this process.

Other major components are meditation, ethical behavior, breathing and contemplation."
MTSI_AI,"MT SINAI.    	According to the Bible, Mount Sinai is the mountain on which Moses was given the Ten Commandments. The Biblical Mount Sinai is probably not the mountain in Egypt that today has the same name, although this is the subject of much debate.

The longer gentler climb takes about 2 1/2 hours, but there is also the steeper climb up the 3,750 ""steps of penitence""."
