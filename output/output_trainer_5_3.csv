I've been sharing here on the blog that the storyline is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader has convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. The love story is perhaps represented by the oft-quoted opening lines of the last chapter, ""Reader, I married him"". I think I'll check out the film again as a first step ..."

The Yser is often associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war, the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended.

The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history that didn't make it to number one. That record I think reflects the fact that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends.

When 'The West Wing' first aired, Seaborn was billed as the show's main character, but outstanding performances from the rest of the cast and some great writing meant that Lowe's role became 'one of many'. This led to some dissatisfaction on Lowe's part, and eventually he quit the show."

Keyboard key.   		3 letters,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters.
