DI_,"DIE.    	As we all know, the numbers on dice are arranged so that the opposite faces add up to seven. Given this arrangement, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 all meet at a common vertex. Now, there are two ways of arranging the 1, 2 and 3 around the common vertex, a so called right-handed die (clockwise 1-2-3) or a left-handed die (counterclockwise 1-2-3). Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."
ELN_NO,"EL NINO.    	When the surface temperature of much of the Pacific Ocean rises more that half a degree centigrade, then there is said to be an El Niño episode. That small temperature change in the Pacific has been associated with climatic changes that can stretch right across the globe. El Niño is Spanish for ""the boy"" and is a reference to the Christ child. The phenomenon was given this particular Spanish name because the warming is usually noticed near South America and around Christmas-time."

One was his own son, Girolamo, and another was the famed Antonio Stradivari."
O_DS,"OLDS.    	The REO Motor Company was founded by Ransom Eli Olds (hence the name REO). The company made cars, trucks and buses, and was in business from 1905 to 1975 in Lansing, Michigan. Among the company's most famous models were the REO Royale and the REO Flying Cloud."
C_O,"CRO.    	Remains of early man, dating back to 35,000 years ago, were found in Abri de Cro-Magnon in southwest France, giving the name to those early humans. Cro-Magnon remains are the oldest human relics that have been discovered in Europe."
F_R,"FDR.    	About a year before the US entered into WWII, President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered a radio broadcast to the American people in which he pledged support for the UK against Nazi Germany, without getting the US involved in actual fighting. The support promised was the arming of the Allies in Europe by using the industrial might of America, what he called 'the Arsenal of Democracy'."
OMA_I,"OMANI.    	The Arabian Peninsula is shaped like a boot, with the Sultanate of Oman occupying the toe of that boot."
E_T,EDT.    	Eastern Daylight Time.

Lye can make olives less bitter, for example. The chemical is also found in canned mandarin oranges, pretzels and Japanese ramen noodles. More concentrated grades of lye are used to clear drains and clean ovens. Scary ..."
_LED,"SLED.    	A luge is a small sled used by one or two people, on which one lies face up and feet first. The luge can be compared to the skeleton, a sled for only one person and on which the rider lies face down and goes down the hill head-first. Yikes!"
IRAN_,"IRANI.    	Tehran is the capital of Iran and is the largest city in the Middle East, with a population of about 8.5 million. Iran has been around an awful long time and Tehran is actually the country's 31st national capital. We are only babies over here in the US ..."
_UDI,"AUDI.    	The Audi name has an interesting history. The Horch company was founded by August Horch in 1909, but soon after Horch was forced out of his own business. He set up a new company and continued to use his own name as a brand. The old company sued him for using the Horch name so a meeting was held to choose something new. Horch's young son was studying Latin in the room where the meeting was taking place. He pointed out that ""Horch"" was German for ""hear"", and he suggested ""Audi"" as a replacement, the Latin for ""listen""."
FD_,"FDR.    	The full name of FDR Drive in New York City is the Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive. It is a parkway that runs along the East River for almost ten miles through Manhattan.

In turn, they were succeeded by Girolamo's son, Nicolo. Nicolo had a few students who achieved fame making musical instruments as well. One was his own son, Girolamo, and another was the famed Antonio Stradivari."
_PRAH,"OPRAH.    	The full name of the publication usually called 'O', is 'O: The Oprah Magazine'. Since the magazine's founding in 2000, Oprah has appeared alone on the cover of each issue, with two exceptions. On the April 2009 cover Oprah was shown with First Lady Michelle Obama, and on the December 2009 cover Oprah shared the limelight with Ellen DeGeneres."
LAT_E,"LATTE.    	The term 'latte' is an abbreviation of the Italian ""caffelatte"" meaning ""coffee (and) milk"". Note that in the correct spelling of ""latte"", the Italian word for milk, there is no accent over the ""e"". An accent is often added by mistake when we use the word in English, perhaps meaning to suggest that the word is French."
RO_N,"ROAN.    	A roan horse has a base coloring of perhaps red, black or brown, but that base color is lightened by white hairs throughout the shade."
EN_AC,"ENIAC.    	The acronym ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (although many folks insist that the C was for ""Computer""). ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables, but it ended up being used early on to make calculations necessary for the development of the hydrogen bomb. Given its uses, it's not surprising to hear that development of ENIAC was funded by the US Army during WWII."
ANI_E,ANISE.    	The drink usually called just 'Pernod' is a French beverage more correctly called 'Pernod Anise'. The brand name was created by Henri-Louis Pernod in the late 1700s when he opened an absinthe distillery in Switzerland.

Dante is led on a journey by the poet, Virgil, starting at the gates of Hell, on which are written the words ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here""."
KO_LA,"KOALA.    	The koala bear really does look like a little bear, but it's not even closely related. The koala is an arboreal marsupial and a herbivore, native to the east and south coasts of Australia. Koalas aren't primates, and are one of the few mammals other than primates who have fingerprints. In fact, it can be very difficult to tell human fingerprints from koala fingerprints, even under an electron microscope. I'm a little jealous of the koala, as it sleeps up to 20 hours a day ..."
OP_AH,"OPRAH.    	What can you say about Oprah? Born into poverty to a single mother, with a harrowing childhood, Oprah is now the greatest African American philanthropist the world has ever known. Oprah's name was originally meant to be ""Orpah"" after the Biblical character in the Book of Ruth, and that's how it appears on her birth certificate. Apparently folks had trouble pronouncing ""Orpah"", so she's now ""Oprah""."
STAR_,"STARR.    	Ringo Starr's real name is Richard Starkey. Before he joined the Beatles (replacing drummer Pete Best), Starkey played with the Raving Texans. It was with the Raving Texans that he adopted the name ""Ringo Starr"", because he wore a lot of rings and he thought it sounded ""cowboyish"". Back then his drum solos were billed as ""Starr Time""."
ASIA_,"ASIAN.    	There are only three species of elephant living today, with all others being extinct. These are the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant (or ""Indian elephant""). As is well known, the African elephant is distinguished from the Asian/Indian elephant by its much larger ears."
E_T,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world, living on land or in the water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants, unlike the eggs of frogs and toads which float freely. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."
_LO,FLO.    	Flo is a perky character featured in ads for Progressive Insurance. Flo is played by comedienne and actress Stephanie Courtney.
U_DA,"USDA.    	The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) actually dates back to 1862 when it was established by then-president Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln referred to the USDA as the ""people's department"" as our economy had such a vast agrarian base back then."
M_CE,"MACE.    	Mace is actually a brand name, originally introduced by Lake Erie Chemical when they started to manufacture ""Chemical Mace"", with the name being a play on the club-like weapon from days of old. Mace was originally a form of tear gas, but Mace today uses a formula that is actually a pepper spray."
NH_,"NHL.    	The Senators are the NHL hockey team in Ottawa, Canada. The current team, founded in the 1992-93 season, is the second NHL team in the city to use the name ""Senators"". The original team was founded in 1917, and had a very successful run until the league expanded into the US in the late twenties. The cost of operating in what became the smallest NHL city eventually drove the Senators to St. Louis where the team played for a year as the Eagles before finally folding."
LE_A,"LEDA.    	In Greek mythology, Leda was the beautiful Queen of Sparta who was seduced by Zeus, in the form of a swan. She produced two eggs from the union. One egg hatched into the beautiful Helen, later to be known as Helen of Troy over whom the Trojan War was fought. The other egg hatched into the twins Castor and Pollux. Castor and Pollux had different fathers in the myth. Castor was the son of Zeus, so was immortal, while Pollux was the son of Leda's earthly husband, so he was mortal."
EM_L,"EMIL.    	Emil Gilels was a pianist from the old Soviet Union, born in Odessa (now part of Ukraine). Gilels was one of the first musicians allowed to perform concerts outside of the Eastern Bloc. His debut appearance in Philadelphia with Eugene Ormandy was a resounding success."

Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."
_CET,"ICE-T.    	Rapper Ice-T must be sick of having his name come up as an answer in crossword puzzles. Maybe he should have stuck to his real name, Tracy Marrow? Then again, maybe not ... Ice-T has been interested in acting for decades and made his film debut in the 1984 movie about break-dancing called 'Breakin''. He has also played Detective Fin Tutuola in the TV show 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' since the year 2000."

AX_L,AXEL.    	An Axel is a forward take-off jump in figure skating. It was first performed by Norwegian Axel Paulsen at the 1882 World Figure Skating championships.
P_I,"POI.    	I am a big fan of starch, and being an Irishman I love potatoes however they are prepared. That said, poi is horrible! Poi is made from the bulbous tubers (corm) of the taro plant, by cooking the corm in water and mashing it with water until the desired consistency is achieved."
S_HO,"SOHO.    	The Manhattan neighborhood known today as SoHo was very fashionable in the early 1900s, but as the well-heeled started to move uptown the area became very run down and poorly maintained. Noted for the number of fires that erupted in derelict buildings, it earned the nickname ""Hell's Hundred Acres"". The area was rezoned for manufacturing and became home to many sweatshops. In the mid-1900s artists started to move into open loft spaces and began renovating old buildings as the lofts were ideal locations in which an artist could both live and work. In 1968, artists and others organized themselves so that they could legalize their residential use of an area zoned for manufacturing. The group they formed took its name from the name given to the area by the city's Planning Commission i.e ""South of Houston"". This was shortened from So-uth of Ho-uston to SoHo, as in the SoHo Artists Association, and the name stuck."
_HL,"NHL.    	The National Hockey League (NHL) was formed in 1917 in Montreal, a successor to the defunct National Hockey Association (NHA) that had been founded in 1909."
ADL_B,"AD LIB.    	""Ad libitum"" is a Latin phrase meaning ""at one's pleasure"". In common usage the phrase is usually shortened to ""ad lib"".

Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."
T_O,"TWO.    	A prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. There are still some unanswered questions involving prime numbers, perhaps most notably Goldbach's Conjecture. This conjecture dates back to the 1740s and is assumed to be true, but has never been proven. It states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."
_SA,"GSA.    	The US Government's General Services Administration (GSA), as the name suggests, provides general services to other federal agencies. So for example, the GSA manages office space for the other agencies, and transportation."
_OOT,"MOOT.    	I reckon this clue is backwards. To moot, is to bring up as a subject for discussion or debate. So, something that is moot is open to debate. Something that is no longer moot, is no longer worth debating."

_PIA,"APIA.    	Apia is the capital city, in fact the only city, of the Pacific island-nation of Samoa. The harbor of Apia is famous for a very foolish incident in 1889 involving seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain. A typhoon was approaching so the safest thing to do was to head for open water away from land, but no nation would move its ships for fear of losing face in front of the others. Six of the vessels were lost in the typhoon as a result and 200 American and German sailors perished. The British cruiser HMS Calliope barely managed to escape from the harbor and rode out the storm safely."
US_,"USB.    	Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard dealing with how computers and electronic devices connect and communicate, and deal with electrical power through those connections."
_VA,"TVA.    	The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has to be one of America's great success stories when it comes to economic development.

IP_D,"IPAD.    	Steve Jobs certainly was a business icon in Silicon Valley. I don't think it is too surprising to learn that the brilliant Jobs didn't even finish his college education, dropping out of Reed College in Oregon after only one semester. Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976, but in 1985 he was basically fired from his own company during the computer sales slump of the mid-eighties. Jobs then founded NeXT Computer, a company focused on supplying workstations to the higher education and business markets. Apple purchased NeXT in 1996, and that's how Jobs found himself back with his original company."
_ITA,"PITA.    	Pita is a lovely bread in Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. Pita bread is usually round, and has a ""pocket"" in the center. The pocket is created by steam that puffs up the dough during cooking leaving a void when the bread cools. The pockets were a big hit in the seventies when someone came up with the idea of using them for fillings hence creating pita sandwiches or ""pita pockets""."
_TOA,"STOA.    	A stoa was a covered walkway in Ancient Greece.

There are two ways of arranging the 1, 2 and 3 around the common vertex, a so called right-handed die (clockwise 1-2-3) or a left-handed die (counterclockwise 1-2-3). Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."
_OHO,"SOHO.    	The area of London called Soho had a very poor reputation for most of the 20th century as it was home to the city's red light district. Soho has been transformed though, and has been a very fashionable neighborhood since the 1980s."

NC_,"NCR.    	NCR is an American company that has been in business since 1884, originally called the National Cash Register Company. The company has done well in a market where new technologies seem to be constantly disrupting the status quo."
SOH_,"SOHO.    	The Manhattan neighborhood known today as SoHo was very fashionable in the early 1900s, but as the well-heeled started to move uptown the area became very run down and poorly maintained. Noted for the number of fires that erupted in derelict buildings, SoHo earned the nickname ""Hell's Hundred Acres"". The area was then zoned for manufacturing and became home to many sweatshops. In the mid-1900s artists started to move into open loft spaces and renovating old buildings as the lofts were ideal locations in which an artist could both live and work. In 1968, artists and others organized themselves so that they could legalize their residential use of an area zoned for manufacturing. The group they formed took its name from the name given to the area by the city's Planning Commission i.e ""South of Houston"". This was shortened from So-uth of Ho-uston to SoHo as in the SoHo Artists Association, and the name stuck."

M_ED,"MR ED.    	""Mister Ed"" first aired in 1961 and ran for almost five years. It was a very successful show (and even made it to Ireland!). Mister Ed, the talking horse, was a palomino that had the real name of Bamboo Harvester. Mister Ed's ""voice"" was that of actor Allan ""Rocky"" Lane, a star of a lot of B-movie westerns from the forties and fifties. In the show, Mister Ed would only talk to the lead (human) character Wilbur, played by Alan Young, leading to some hilarious situations. Mister Ed had a stunt double and stand-in for the show, another horse called Pumpkin. Pumpkin later played the horse that made frequent appearances on the show ""Green Acres""."
PO_,"POI.    	The corm of some taro plants is used to make poi, the traditional Hawaiian dish (that I think tastes horrible). When a taro plant is grown as an ornamental, it is often called Elephant Ears due to the shape of its large leaves."

SSN_,"SSNS.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, the SSN is looking more and more like an ""universal identity number"". The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. The IRS suspected that a lot of people were claiming children who did not exist as dependents on their tax forms, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in the following year's tax returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."
_OM,"ROM.    	CD-ROM stands for ""compact disc read only memory"". That means you can read information from the disc (like a standard music CD for example), but you can't write to it. You can also buy a CD-RW, which stands for ""compact disc - rewritable"", with which you can read data and also write over it multiple times using a suitable CD drive."
_OS,"IOS.    	The Cyclades are a group of islands in the Aegean Sea lying southeast of the Greek mainland. There are about 200 islands in the group, almost all of which are the peaks of a submerged mountain range. Ios is one of the larger islands, 11 miles long and 6 miles wide."
T_M,"TAM.    	A tam o'shanter is a man's cap traditionally worn by Scotsmen. ""Tams"" were originally all blue (and called ""blue bonnets""), but as more dyes became readily available they became more colorful. The name of the cap comes from the title character of Robert Burns' poem ""Tam O'Shanter""."
AD_IB,"AD LIB.    	""Ad libitum"" is a Latin phrase meaning ""at one's pleasure"". In common usage the phrase is usually shortened to ""ad lib"". On the stage the concept of an ""ad lib"" is very familiar. For example, an actor may substitute his or her own words for forgotten lines using an ad lib, or a director may instruct an actor to use his or her own words at a particular point in a performance to promote a sense of spontaneity."
P_AT,PSAT.    	Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT)
_ENS,"YENS.    	The word ""yen"", meaning ""urge"", has been around in English since the very early 1900s. It comes from the earlier word ""yin"" imported from Chinese, which was used in English to describe an intense craving for opium!"
_LEVE,"ALEVE.    	Aleve is an anti-inflammatory drug, Naproxen sodium."
A_O,"ABO.    	The most important grouping of blood types is the ABO system. Blood is classified as either A, B, AB or O, depending on the type of antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. A secondary designation of blood is the Rh factor, in which other antigens are labelled as either positive or negative. When a patient receives a blood transfusion, ideally the donor blood should be the same type as that of the recipient, as incompatible blood cells can be rejected. However, blood type O-neg can be accepted by recipients with all blood types, A, B, AB or O, and positive or negative. Hence someone with O-neg blood type is called a ""universal donor""."
_PGA,"LPGA.    	The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) was founded in 1950 by a group of 13 lady golfers, and today it is the oldest ongoing women's sports professional organization in the US."

LE_,"LEA.    	The word ""bucolic"", meaning rustic or rural, comes to us from the Greek word ""boukolos"" meaning ""cowherd""."
ALIC_,"ALICE.    	Lewis Carroll wrote ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" in 1865, and the sequel in 1871 called ""Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There"". Because in the second adventure Alice went through a looking glass, the themes were deliberately chosen to be mirror images of the themes in ""Wonderland"". Whereas ""Wonderland"" begins indoors, is set in summer, and uses playing card imagery, ""Looking Glass"" begins out of doors, is set in winter and uses images from the game of chess."
S_LA,"SELA.    	The actress Sela Ward turns up in crosswords a lot. Ward played Teddy Reed in the TV show ""Sisters"" in the nineties, and was in ""Once and Again"" from 1999-2002. I don't know either show, but I do know Ward from the medical drama ""House"" in which she played the hospital's lawyer and Greg House's ex-partner. That was a fun role, I thought. More recently Ward played a lead role on ""CSI: NY"" and was a very welcome and much-needed addition to the cast ..."

STAR_,"STARR.    	Ringo Starr's real name is Richard Starkey. Before he joined the Beatles (replacing drummer Pete Best), Starkey played with the Raving Texans. It was with the Raving Texans that he adopted the name ""Ringo Starr"", because he wore a lot of rings and he thought it sounded ""cowboyish"". Back then his drum solos were billed as ""Starr Time""."
ODES_A,"ODESSA.    	""The Battleship Potemkin"" is a silent movie made in 1925. A famous scene in the movie takes place in the port of Odessa, when Tsarist soldiers massacre rebels on the giant stairway in the city, now known as the Potemkin Stairs."

EBO_,"EBON.    	The words 'I did encounter that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink' are from Shakespeare's play 'Love's Labour Lost'."

_HARE,"O'HARE.    	O'Hare International is the fourth busiest airport in the world. The original airport was constructed on the site between 1942 an 1943, and was used by the Douglas Aircraft Company for the manufacture of planes during WWII.

This name is the derivation of the airport's current location identifier: ORD."

ECO_,"ECON.    	The Peace Prize is the most famous of the five prizes bequeathed by Alfred Nobel. The others are for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature. There is also a Nobel Prize in Economics that is awarded along with the original five, but it is funded separately and is awarded ""in memory of Alfred Nobel"". Four of the prizes are awarded by Swedish organizations (Alfred Nobel was a Swede) and so the award ceremonies take place in Stockholm. The Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and that award is presented in Oslo."

_YE,"LYE.    	What we call 'lye' is usually sodium hydroxide, although historically the term was used for potassium hydroxide. Lye has many uses, including to cure several foodstuffs. Lye can make olives less bitter, for example. The chemical is also found in canned mandarin oranges, pretzels and Japanese ramen noodles. More concentrated grades of lye are used to clear drains and clean ovens. Scary ..."
E_NINO,"EL NINO.    	When the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean rises or falls more that half a degree centigrade, then there is said to be an El Nino episode. That small temperature change in the Pacific has been associated with climatic changes that can stretch right across the globe. El Nino is Spanish for ""the boy"" and is a reference to the Christ child. It was given this Spanish name because the warming is usually noticed near South America and around Christmas-time."
FR_,"FRA.    	The title ""Fra"" (brother) is used by Italian monks."
A_ENA,ARENA.    	Thunderdome is a jousting arena that features in the 1985 movie 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'.

E_E,"EKE.    	I believe that technically speaking one can't actually ""eke out"" an existence, as to ""eke out"" means to ""make something go further or last longer"". So, you can eke out your income by cutting back on expenses, but you can't eke out your existence, or any existence."
E_T,EDT.    	A farmer in Delaware will be working in the Eastern Daylight Saving time zone.
TR_S,TRES.    	Très bien! Very (très) good (bien) in French.
A_IA,"APIA.    	Apia is the capital city, in fact the only ""city"", of the Pacific island nation of Samoa. The harbor of Apia is famous for a very foolish incident in 1889 involving seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain. A typhoon was approaching, so the safest thing to do was head for open water away from land, but no nation would move its ships for fear of losing face in front of the others. Six of the vessels were lost in the typhoon as a result, and 200 American and German sailors perished. The British cruiser HMS Calliope barely managed to escape from the harbor and rode out the storm safely."

EBO_,"EBON.    	Ebony is another word for the color black (often shortened to ""ebon"" in poetry). Ebony is a dark, black wood that is very dense, and is one of the few types of wood that sinks in water. Ebony has been in high demand, so the species of trees yielding the wood are now considered threatened. It's in such short supply that unscrupulous vendors have been known to darken lighter woods with shoe polish to look like ebony, so be warned ..."

A_EA,"AREA.    	The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is a mathematical constant, which we denote with the Greek letter pi (π). The ratio pi can be used to calculate the area of a disk, by multiplying the constant by the square of the radius (πr2)."
KOAL_,"KOALA.    	The koala bear really does look like a little bear, but it's not even closely related. The koala is an arboreal marsupial and a herbivore, native to the east and south coasts of Australia. Koalas aren't primates, and are one of the few mammals other than primates who have fingerprints. In fact, it can be very difficult to tell human fingerprints from koala fingerprints, even under an electron microscope. Male koalas are called 'bucks', females are 'does', and young koalas are 'joeys'. I'm a little jealous of the koala, as it sleeps up to 20 hours a day ..."
O_DS,OLDS.    	Oldsmobile was an automobile brand founded by Ransom E. Olds (REO) in 1897. The brand was finally phased out by General Motors in 2004.
AU_I,"AUDI.    	The Audi name has an interesting history. The Horch company was founded by August Horch in 1909. Early in the life of the new company, Horch was forced out of his own business. He set up a new enterprise and continued to use his own name as a brand. The old company sued him for using the Horch name so a meeting was held to choose something new. Horch's young son was studying Latin in the room where the meeting was taking place. He pointed out that ""Horch"" was German for ""hear"" and he suggested ""Audi"" as a replacement, the Latin for ""listen""."
HA_,"HAM.    	The 'croque monsieur' is a French dish, a baked or fried ham and cheese sandwich. Before baking, the sandwich is dipped in whipped eggs. The cheese used is traditionally Emmental or Gruyère. If the sandwich is topped with a fried egg, then it referred to as a croque madame."

Her association with Robeson, a prominent civil rights activist, earned her a spot on the Hollywood Blacklist during the McCarthy Era. This forced her away from film, but towards a successful stage career in New York City."

Soon after, she gathered a group of admirers around her with whom she discussed philosophy and shared drafts of her magnum opus, ""Atlas Shrugged"".

E_HER,"ETHER.    	Ethers are a whole class of organic compounds, but in the vernacular 'ether' is specifically diethyl ether. Diethyl ether was once very popular as a general anesthetic."
_RKS,"ARKS.    	The term 'ark', when used with reference to Noah, is a translation of the Hebrew word 'tebah'. The word 'tebah' is also used in the Bible for the basket in which Moses was placed by his mother when she floated him down the Nile. It seems that the word 'tebah' doesn't mean 'boat' and nor does it mean 'basket'. Rather, a more appropriate translation is 'life-preserver' or 'life-saver'. So, Noah's ark was Noah's life-preserver during the flood."
OD_SSA,"ODESSA.    	The Russian battleship Potemkin is perhaps more famous for an on-board rebellion than for any naval action. In 1905, the Potemkin was on firing exercises when the crew refused to eat meat that contained maggots. The second-in-command gathered the crew on the quarterdeck, and lined them up in front of armed marines. Fearing a mass execution, the crew rushed the marines and began the famous mutiny. The event was reconstructed in an equally famous film by Sergei Eisenstein called ""The Battleship Potemkin"", a silent film released in 1925 that is considered by many to be greatest film of all time."
PO_,"POI.    	The corm of some taro plants is used to make poi, the traditional Hawaiian dish (that I think tastes horrible). When a taro plant is grown as an ornamental, it is often called Elephant Ears due to the shape of its large leaves."
OS_,"OSU.    	The athletic teams of Ohio State University are called the Buckeyes, named after the state tree of Ohio. In turn, the buckeye tree gets its name from the appearance of its fruit, a dark nut with a light patch, thought to resemble a ""buck's eye""."
M_CE,"MACE.    	Mace is actually a brand name, originally introduced by Lake Erie Chemical when they started to manufacture ""Chemical Mace"", with the name being a play on the club-like weapon known as a mace. Mace was originally a form of tear gas, but the brand name Mace is used a formula that is actually a pepper spray, a different formulation."
EM_S,EMTS.    	Emergency medical technician (EMT)
IPA_,"IPAD.    	Steve Jobs certainly was a business icon in Silicon Valley. I don't think it is too surprising to learn that the brilliant Jobs didn't even finish his college education, dropping out of Reed College in Oregon after only one semester. Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976, but in 1985 he was basically fired from his own company during the computer sales slump of the mid-eighties. Jobs then founded NeXT Computer, a company focused on supplying workstations to the higher education and business markets.

France ruled the country as part of French Indochina, having united three separate Lao kingdoms. As there was a plural of ""Lao"" entities united into one, the French added the ""S"" and so today we tend to use ""Laos"" instead of ""Lao""."

_PS,OPS.    	Ops (also 'Opis') was the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Rhea. She was the wife of Saturn.

An ogee arch is composed of two ogees, with one being the mirror of the other and meeting at the arch's apex."
S_HO,"SOHO.    	The Manhattan neighborhood known today as SoHo was very fashionable in the early 1900s, but as the well-heeled started to move uptown the area became very run down and poorly maintained. Noted for the number of fires that erupted in derelict buildings, SoHo earned the nickname ""Hell's Hundred Acres"". The area was then zoned for manufacturing and became home to many sweatshops. In the mid-1900s artists started to move into open loft spaces and renovating old buildings as the lofts were ideal locations in which an artist could both live and work. In 1968, artists and others organized themselves so that they could legalize their residential use of an area zoned for manufacturing. The group they formed took its name from the name given to the area by the city's Planning Commission i.e ""South of Houston"". This was shortened from So-uth of Ho-uston to SoHo as in the SoHo Artists Association, and the name stuck."

SS_S,"SSNS.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."
_PS,"OPS.    	The word ""op"" can go with the word ""photo"", giving us ""photo op"", short for ""photograph opportunity""."
IZ_D,"IZOD.    	Jack Izod was a tailor of some repute over in England, producing shirts for King George V as well as other members of the Royal Family.

_UNE,"RUNE.    	""Beowulf"" is an old epic poem from England, although the story is set in Scandinavia. Beowulf fights a battle, defending the Danish King Hrothgar from the ferocious outcast Grendel. Hrothgar had built a great hall for his people in which they could celebrate; singing, dancing and drinking lots of mead. Grendel was angered by the carousing, and attacked the hall, devouring many of the incumbent warriors as they slept. A bit of an extreme reaction to noisy neighbors I'd say ..."

Some of the most successful were ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", and the longest running musical in the world, ""Les Miserables""."
A_DI,"AUDI.    	The Audi name has an interesting history. The Horch company was founded by August Horch in 1909. Early in the life of the new company, Horch was forced out of his own business. He set up a new enterprise and continued to use his own name as a brand. The old company sued him for using the Horch name so a meeting was held to choose something new. Horch's young son was studying Latin in the room where the meeting was taking place. He pointed out that ""Horch"" was German for ""hear"" and he suggested ""Audi"" as a replacement, the Latin for ""listen""."

O_U,"OSU.    	The athletic teams of Ohio State University are called the Buckeyes, named after the state tree of Ohio. In turn the buckeye tree gets its name from the appearance of its fruit, a dark nut with a light patch thought to resemble a ""buck's eye""."
ODE_SA,"ODESSA.    	The city of Odessa, Texas has as its symbol the jack rabbit. This is because from the thirties through the seventies the city hosted a rodeo for roping rabbits. The Humane Society applied pressure and the city did away with the tradition in 1977."

Sure enough, in the following year's tax returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

SS_S,SSNS.    	Social Security number (SSN)
K_ALA,"KOALA.    	The koala bear really does look like a little bear, but it's not even closely related. The koala is an arboreal marsupial and a herbivore, native to the east and south coasts of Australia. Koalas aren't primates, and are one of the few mammals other than primates who have fingerprints. In fact, it can be very difficult to tell human fingerprints from koala fingerprints, even under an electron microscope. Male koalas are called 'bucks', females are 'does', and young koalas are 'joeys'. I'm a little jealous of the koala, as it sleeps up to 20 hours a day ..."

OM_NI,"OMANI.    	Muscat is the capital of Oman, and lies on the northeast coast of the state on the Gulf of Oman, a branch of the Persian Gulf."
L_R,"LTR.    	Like so many things it seems, our paper sizes here in North America don't conform with the standards in the rest of the world. ISO standard sizes used elsewhere have some logic behind them in that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard size of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government. Prior to this, the ""legal"" size (8.5 x 14 inches) had been the standard, since 1921."

The harbor of Apia is famous for a very foolish incident in 1889 involving seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain. A typhoon was approaching, so the safest thing to do was head for open water away from land. No ship would move for fear of losing face in front of the other nations. Six of the vessels were lost in the typhoon as a result, and 200 American and German sailors perished. The British cruiser HMS Calliope barely managed to escape from the harbor and rode out the storm safely."
DE_,"DEE.    	The last letter in the word ""gold"" is ""dee""."
AT_,"ATF.    	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is today part of the Department of Justice.

Lawless reprised the role in a series called 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys'. Xena became so popular that a series was built around her character, with Lawless retained for the title role.

A few years later, Kilmer was chosen for the lead in another big production, ""Batman Forever"". Things haven't really gone as well for Kilmer since then, I'd say.

The Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and that award is presented in Oslo."
_DR,"FDR.    	Since the days of President George Washington, there was an informal tradition that a US President could hold office for two terms, but would not run for a third. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the only president to break with this tradition. President Roosevelt was elected to office four times, and died a few months after starting his fourth term.

LAO_,"LAOS.    	The official name for the country of Laos is the Lao People's Democratic Republic. In the Lao language, the country's name is ""Meuang Lao"". The French ruled Laos as part of French Indochina, having united three separate Lao kingdoms. As there was a plural of ""Lao"" entities united into one, the French added the ""S"" and so today we tend to use ""Laos"" instead of ""Lao""."
AVI_,"AVIA.    	The Avia brand name for athletic shoes was chosen as ""avia"" is the Latin word for ""to fly"", and suggests the concept of aviation. Avia was founded in Oregon in 1979."
KOAL_,"KOALA.    	The koala bear really does look like a little bear, but it's not even closely related. The koala is an arboreal marsupial and a herbivore, native to the east and south coasts of Australia. Koalas aren't primates, and are one of the few mammals other than primates who have fingerprints. In fact, it can be very difficult to tell human fingerprints from koala fingerprints, even under an electron microscope. Male koalas are called 'bucks', females are 'does', and young koalas are 'joeys'. I'm a little jealous of the koala, as it sleeps up to 20 hours a day ..."
AMAT_,"AMATI.    	The first of the Amati family to make violins was Andrea Amati, who lived in the 14th century. He was succeeded by his sons, Antonio and Girolamo. In turn, they were succeeded by Girolamo's son, Nicolo. Nicolo had a few students who achieved fame making musical instruments as well. One was his own son, Girolamo, and another was the famed Antonio Stradivari."
TR_S,"TRES.    	""Très chic"" is a French term meaning ""very stylish""."
_DLIB,"AD LIB.    	""Ad libitum"" is a Latin phrase meaning ""at one's pleasure"". In common usage the phrase is usually shortened to ""ad lib"". On the stage the concept of an ""ad lib"" is very familiar. For example, an actor may substitute his or her own words for forgotten lines using an ad lib, or a director may instruct an actor to use his or her own words at a particular point in a performance to promote a sense of spontaneity."
EL_INO,"EL NINO.    	When the surface temperature of much of the Pacific Ocean rises more that half a degree centigrade, then there is said to be an El Niño episode. That small temperature change in the Pacific has been associated with climatic changes that can stretch right across the globe. El Niño is Spanish for ""the boy"" and is a reference to the Christ child. The phenomenon was given this particular Spanish name because the warming is usually noticed near South America and around Christmas-time."
EST_,"ESTE.    	Este is a town in the Province of Padua in the north of Italy. The town gave its name to the House of Este, a European princely dynasty. Members of the House of Este were important patrons of the arts, especially during the Italian Renaissance. The House of Hanover, that ruled Britain from 1714 to 1901 when Queen Victoria died, was perhaps the most notable branch of the House of Este."
_UDI,"AUDI.    	The Audi name has an interesting history. The Horch company was founded by August Horch in 1909. Early in the life of the new company, Horch was forced out of his own business. He set up a new enterprise and continued to use his own name as a brand. The old company sued him for using the Horch name so a meeting was held to choose something new. Horch's young son was studying Latin in the room where the meeting was taking place. He pointed out that ""Horch"" was German for ""hear"" and he suggested ""Audi"" as a replacement, the Latin for ""listen""."
T_NA,"TINA.    	Tina Brown is a British/American journalist and author. Brown wrote ""The Diana Chronicles"", a biography of Diana, Princess of Wales, of whom Brown was a personal friend. She emigrated to the US in 1984 to become editor for 'Vanity Fair', and later took the helm at 'The New Yorker'."
_SO,"USO.    	The United Service Organization (USO) was founded in 1941 at the request of FDR ""to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces"". A USO tour is undertaken by a troupe of entertainers, many of whom are big-name celebrities. A USO tour usually includes troop locations in combat zones."
L_LA,"LOLA.    	""Lola"" is a fabulous song, written by Ray Davies and released by the Kinks back in 1970. Inspired by a real life incident, the lyrics tell of young man who met a young ""lady"" in a club, danced with her, and then discovered ""she"" was actually a transvestite. The storyline isn't very traditional, but the music is superb."
ST_NO,"STENO.    	Stenography is the process of writing in shorthand. The term comes from the Greek ""steno"" (narrow) and ""graphe"" (writing)."
_VA,"TVA.    	The Tennessee Valley Authority has to be one of America's great success stories when it comes to economic development. Created in 1933, the TVA spearheaded economic development in the Tennessee Valley at the height of the Great Depression. Central to the success was the federally funded construction of flood control and electricity generation facilities."
P_I,"POI.    	I am a big fan of starch, and being an Irishman I love potatoes however they are prepared. That said, poi is horrible! Poi is made from the bulbous tubers (corm) of the taro plant, by cooking the corm in water and mashing it with water until the desired consistency is achieved."
E_HER,"ETHER.    	The Greek philosopher Empedocles proposed that there are four elements that made up the universe, namely earth, water, air and fire. Aristotle later proposed a fifth element which he called aether (also ""ether""). Aether was the divine substance that made up the stars and planets."
L_LA,"LOLA.    	""Lola"" is a fabulous song, written Ray Davies and released by the Kinks back in 1970. Inspired by a real life incident, the lyrics tell of young man who met a young ""lady"" in a club, was dancing with her, and then discovered ""she"" was actually a transvestite. The storyline isnt very traditional, but the music is superb."
M_ORI,"MAORI.    	The Māori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. The Māori are eastern Polynesian in origin and began arriving in New Zealand relatively recently, starting sometime in the late 13th century. The word ""māori"" simply means ""normal"", distinguishing the mortal human being from spiritual entities."
_ENA,"XENA.    	The Xena character, famously played by New Zealander Lucy Lawless, was introduced in a made-for-TV movie called 'Hercules and the Amazon Women'. Lawless reprised the role in a series called ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"". Xena became so popular that a series was built around her character, with Lawless retained for the title role. The fictional Xena supposedly came from the 'non-fictional' Greek city of Amphipolis."
U_A,"UTA.    	Uta Hagen was a German-born American actress. Hagen married Jose Ferrer in 1938, but they were divorced ten years later after it was revealed that she was having a long-running affair with Paul Robeson. Her association with Robeson, a prominent civil rights activist, earned her a spot on the Hollywood Blacklist during the McCarthy Era. This forced her away from film, but towards a successful stage career in New York City."
ES_EX,"ESSEX.    	Essex County, New Jersey is actually in the New York Metropolitan Area. The county seat is Newark."
LE_A,"LEDA.    	In Greek mythology, Leda was the beautiful Queen of Sparta who was seduced by Zeus when he took the form of a swan. Leda produced two eggs from the union. One egg hatched into the beautiful Helen, later to be known as Helen of Troy and over whom the Trojan War was fought. The other egg hatched into the twins Castor and Pollux. Castor and Pollux had different fathers according to the myth. Pollux was the son of Zeus and was immortal, while Castor was the son of Leda's earthly husband, and so he was a mortal. William Butler Yeats wrote a famous sonnet called 'Leda and the Swan' in 1924. Peter Paul Rubens made a copy of a painting called 'Leda and the Swan' by Michelangelo, which is now lost."
OLA_,"OLAV.    	Of the many kings of Norway named Olaf (and there have been five), Olaf II is perhaps the most remembered as he was canonized and made patron saint of the country. Olaf was king from 1015 to 1028, and was known as ""Olaf the Big"" during his reign. Today he is more commonly referred to as ""Olaf the Holy""."
I_IAD,"ILIAD.    	The Iliad is an epic poem by the Greek poet Homer, which tells the story of the siege of Ilium during the Trojan war."
LO_A,"LOLA.    	""Whatever Lola Wants"" is a song from the musical ""Damn Yankees"". ""Damn Yankees"" is actually yet another version of the classic German legend of ""Faust"", set in Washington, D.C. in the fifties. The show was written by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, a production that turned out to be a very successful follow-up to their prior hit, ""The Pajama Game"". The future was looking really rosy for Adler and Ross but, sadly, Jerry Ross died of an obstructive lung disease only a few weeks after ""Damn Yankees"" opened on Broadway in 1955. He was just 29 years old."
_MOO,"OMOO.    	""Omoo: A Narrative of the South Seas"" is Herman Melville's auto-biographical sequel to ""Typee""."
AL_R,"ALAR.    	The chemical name for Alar, a plant growth regulator and color enhancer, is daminozide. Alar was primarily used on apples but was withdrawn from the market when it was linked to cancer."
DE_,DEE.    	Billy Dee Williams is the actor who played the character Lando Calrissian in two of the 'Star Wars' movies.
U_O,"USO.    	The United Service Organization (USO) was founded in 1941 at the request of FDR ""to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces"". A USO tour is undertaken by a troupe of entertainers, many of whom are big-name celebrities. A USO tour usually includes troop locations in combat zones."
C_R,"CPR.    	Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation used to involve the simultaneous compression of the chest to pump blood using the heart, and artificial respiration by blowing air into the lungs. Nowadays emergency services are placing more emphasis on the heart compressions, and less on the artificial respiration."
EMT_,"EMTS.    	The first use of an emergency phone number nationally was in the UK in 1937, where the number 999 was introduced to call emergency services. If you need emergency services in the UK or Ireland to this day, you have to dial 999. It's not really clear why 911 became the emergency number in the US. The most credible suggestion (to me) is that when it was introduced by the FCC in 1967, it was a number that ""fit"" with the numbers already used by AT&T for free services (211-long distance; 411-information; 611-repair service)."
OSA_A,"OSAKA.    	The Japanese city of Osaka used to be called Naniwa, with the name changing to Osaka some time before 1500. ""Osaka"" can be translated either as ""large hill"" or ""large slope""."
_SB,"USB.    	Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard dealing with how computers and electronic devices connect and communicate, and deal with electrical power through those connections."
A_EL,AXEL.    	An Axel is a forward take-off jump in figure skating. It was first performed by Norwegian Axel Paulsen at the 1882 World Figure Skating championships.
_SAGE,"OSAGE.    	The Osage Nation originated in the Ohio River valley in what we now call Kentucky. They were forced to migrate west of the Mississippi by the invading Iroquois tribe. Most of the tribe members now live in Osage County, Oklahoma. Osage County, Kansas and Osage County, Missouri are both named after the Osage River that runs through them."
E_PYS,ESPYS.    	The ESPY Awards are a creation of the ESPN sports television network. One difference with similarly named awards in the entertainment industry is that ESPY winners are chosen solely based on viewer votes.
T_A,"TVA.    	The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has to be one of America's great success stories when it comes to economic development. Created in 1933, the TVA spearheaded economic development in the Tennessee Valley at the height of the Great Depression. Central to the success was the federally-funded construction of flood-control and electricity-generation facilities."

Central to the success was the federally-funded construction of flood-control and electricity-generation facilities."
HA_,"HAM.    	Country ham is a salty, cured ham."
_ANTE,"DANTE.    	Dante Alighieri's ""Divine Comedy"" is an epic poem dating back to the 14th century. The first part of that epic is ""Inferno"", which is the Italian word for ""Hell"". In the poem, Dante is led on a journey by the poet Virgil, starting at the gates of Hell on which are written the famous words ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here""."
_RLES,"ARLES.    	A few years ago I had the privilege of living just a short car-ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although Arles has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design. Arles has a spectacular Roman amphitheater, arch, circus as well as old walls that surround the center of the city. In more modern times, it was a place Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Cafe Terrace at Night"", as well as ""Bedroom in Arles""."
_GEE,OGEE.    	An ogee is like an s-curve. Specifically it is a figure consisting of two arcs that curve in opposite directions (like an S) but both ends of the curve end up parallel to each other (which is not necessarily true for an S).
_EED,"REED.    	The oboe is perhaps my favorite of the reed instruments. The name ""oboe"" comes from the French ""hautbois"" which means ""high wood"". When you hear an orchestra tuning before a performance, you'll note (pun intended!) the oboe starts the process off by playing an ""A"". Everyone tunes in turn to that oboe's ""A"". Oh, and if you want to read a fun book (almost an ""expose"") about life playing the oboe, you might try ""Mozart in the Jungle"" by oboist Blair Tindall."
ESPY_,ESPYS.    	The ESPY Awards are a creation of the ESPN sports television network. One difference with similarly named awards in the entertainment industry is that ESPY winners are chosen solely based on viewer votes.
D_HL,"DAHL.    	The Pet Rock lives on history, even though the fad really only lasted about 6 months, in 1975. It was enough to make Gary Dahl a millionaire though. His next idea, a ""sand farm"", didn't fly at all."
YE_S,"YENS.    	The word ""yen"", meaning ""urge"", has been around in English since the very early 1900s. It comes from the earlier word ""yin"" imported from Chinese, which was used in English to describe an intense craving for opium!"
OLA_,"OLAV.    	Of the many kings of Norway named Olaf/Olav (and there have been five), Olaf II is perhaps the most celebrated as he was canonized and made patron saint of the country. Olaf II was king from 1015 to 1028 and was known as ""Olaf the Big"" (or Olaf the Fat) during his reign. Today he is more commonly referred to as ""Olaf the Holy"". After Olaf died he was given the title of Rex Perpetuus Norvegiae, which is Latin for 'Norway's Eternal King'."
ASI_N,"ASIAN.    	The Kingdom of Thailand was known to outsiders as Siam until 1939. To her citizens, the country has always been known as 'Mueang Thai'. The word 'mueang' means 'nation' and the name 'Thai' comes from 'the Thai people' who are native to the central plains of the country."
IR_S,"IRAS.    	I have to tell you, when I first came to the US from Ireland it was pretty confusing seeing big signs along the freeway advocating IRA contributions. Back in Ireland, contributing to the IRA was pretty illegal (where IRA stands for the outlawed Irish Republican Army!)."
_CER,"ACER.    	I owned several Acer laptops, which were for my money the most reliable machine at the best price. Acer is a Taiwanese company that I used to visit a lot when I was in the electronics business. I was very impressed back then with the company's dedication to quality, but have heard that things have gone so well in recent years ..."
STEN_,"STENO.    	Stenography is the process of writing in shorthand. The term comes from the Greek ""steno"" (narrow) and ""graphe"" (writing)."
_CET,"ICE-T.    	Rapper Ice-T must be sick of having his name come up as an answer in crossword puzzles. Maybe he should have stuck to his real name, Tracy Marrow? Then again, maybe not ... Ice-T has been interested in acting for decades and made his film debut in the 1984 movie about break-dancing called 'Breakin''. He has also played Detective Fin Tutuola in the TV show 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' since the year 2000."
SP_M,"SPAM.    	Apparently the term ""spam"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word Spam, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""spam"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."
LAT_E,"LATTE.    	The term 'latte' is an abbreviation of the Italian 'caffelatte' meaning 'coffee (and) milk'. Note that in the correct spelling of 'latte', the Italian word for milk, there is no accent over the 'e'. An accent is often added by mistake when we use the word in English, perhaps meaning to suggest that the word is French."
_OS,"IOS.    	iOS is what Apple now call their mobile operating system, previously known as iPhone OS."
ELI_,"ELIE.    	Elie Wiesel is a holocaust survivor, best known for his book ""Night"" which tells of his experiences in Auschwitz and Buchenwald."
STAR_,"STARR.    	""It Don't Come Easy"" was one of the first solo singles by Ringo Starr after the breakup of the Beatles in 1970. The song was produced, and co-written, by fellow Beatle George Harrison, and indeed Harrison plays guitar in the original recording. The song refers to the difficulties the Beatles were having at the time of their breakup, hence ... ""It Don't Come Easy""."
_SU,"OSU.    	Ohio State University (OSU) was founded back in 1870 as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The athletic teams of OSU are called the Buckeyes, named after the state tree of Ohio. In turn the buckeye tree gets its name from the appearance of its fruit, a dark nut with a light patch thought to resemble a ""buck's eye""."
DAH_,"DAHL.    	Roald Dahl's name is Norwegian. Dahl's parents were from Norway, although Dahl himself was Welsh. Dahl became one of the most successful authors of the twentieth century, and a couple of his most famous titles are ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""."
F_A,"FAA.    	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was set up in 1958 (as the Federal Aviation Agency). The agency was established at that particular time largely in response to an increasing number of midair collisions. The worst of these disasters had taken place two years earlier over the Grand Canyon, a crash between two commercial passenger airplanes that resulted in 128 fatalities."
THA_,"THAI.    	Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand. The exact etymology of the name 'Bangkok' seems unclear, although 'bang' is a Thai word meaning 'a village situated on a stream'."
_LGA,"OLGA.    	Olga, Queen of the Cossacks is a villain in the 'Batman' stories. On the sixties TV show, Olga was played by Anne Baxter."
AR_,"ARC.    	Sunlight shining through airborne water droplets can produce rainbows. The water droplets act as little prisms, dispersing the white light into its constituent colors. Sometimes we see double rainbows. If we look carefully, the order of the colors in the first and second arcs is reversed."
U_DA,USDA.    	(64A. Inspection target of the 61-Across : MEAT)
IR_N,"IRON.    	There are 12 metal tokens used in Monopoly these days, including the iron. Two tokens, the battleship and the cannon (aka howitzer) were added to the Monopoly as part of a recycling exercise. The pieces were intended for the game ""Conflict"" released in 1940, but when Parker Bros. pulled the game off the market due to poor sales, they added their excess battleships and cannons to Monopoly."
OS_GE,"OSAGE.    	I think the reference here is to the languages, and not perhaps the tribes. Both Dakota and Osage are Siouan languages, really quite similar to each other. Sadly, the Osage language is dying out, with only a handful of speakers left, all quite elderly."
PI_,PIE.    	The first verse of the English nursery rhyme is:
TT_P,"T-TOP.    	A T-top is a car roof that has removable panels on either side of a rigid bar that runs down the center of the vehicle, above the driver."
T_U,"TRU.    	Truman Capote grew up in Monroeville, Alabama. There he met, and became lifelong friends with fellow novelist, Harper Lee. Capote was the inspiration for the character ""Dill"" in Lee's celebrated work ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"". In turn, Harper Lee was the inspiration behind the character ""Idabel"" in Capote's ""Other Voices, Other Rooms""."
D_E,"DIE.    	The numbers on dice are arranged so that the opposite faces add up to seven. Given this arrangement, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 all meet at a common vertex. Now, there are two ways of arranging the 1, 2 and 3 around the common vertex, a so called right-handed die (clockwise 1-2-3) or a left-handed die (counterclockwise 1-2-3). Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."
ACE_,"ACER.    	I am typing away right now in an Acer laptop, for my money the most reliable machine at the best price. Acer is a Taiwanese company that I used to visit a lot when I was in the electronics business. I was very impressed with the company's dedication to quality, and haven't been let down since."
RO_N,"ROAN.    	A roan horse has an even mixture of white and colored hairs on the body with the head, lower legs, mane and tail having a more solid color."
_BC,ABC.    	The letters ABC appear on the 2-button of a telephone's keypad.
_SIAN,ASIAN.    	See 60 across.
ST_RR,"STARR.    	Ringo Starr's real name is Richard Starkey. Before he joined the Beatles (replacing drummer Pete Best), Starkey played with the Raving Texans. It was with the Raving Texans that he adopted the name ""Ringo Starr"" because he wore a lot of rings, and he thought it sounded ""cowboyish"". Back then his drum solos were billed as ""Starr Time""."
API_,"APIA.    	Apia is the capital city, and in fact the only city, of the Pacific island-nation of Samoa. The harbor of Apia is famous for a very foolish incident in 1889 involving seven naval vessels from Germany, the US and Britain. A typhoon was approaching so the safest thing to do was to head for open water away from land, but no nation would move its ships for fear of losing face in front of the others. Six of the ships were lost in the typhoon as a result and 200 American and German sailors perished. The British cruiser HMS Calliope barely managed to escape from the harbor and rode out the storm safely."
ENI_C,"ENIAC.    	The acronym ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (although many folks insist that the C was for ""Computer""). ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables, but it ended up being used early on to make calculations necessary for the development of the hydrogen bomb. Given its uses, it's not surprising to hear that development of ENIAC was funded by the US Army during WWII."
RA_,"RAS.    	RAs are resident assistants or resident advisers, the peer leaders found in residence halls, particularly on a college campus."
E_ON,"EBON.    	Ebony is another word for the color black (often shortened to ""ebon"" in poetry). Ebony is a dark, black wood that is very dense, and is one of the few types of wood that sinks in water. Ebony has been in high demand, so the species of trees yielding the wood are now considered threatened. It's in such short supply, that unscrupulous vendors have been known to darken lighter woods with shoe polish, so watch out ..."
IR_S,IRAS.    	Individual retirement account (IRA)
ANIM_,ANIME.    	Anime is animation in the style of Japanese Manga comic books.
NA_A,"NADA.    	""Nada"" is the Spanish word for ""nothing"". ""De nada"" translates literally from the Spanish as ""of nothing"", and is used to mean ""you're welcome"" or ""don't mention it"". The French have the same expression ""de rien"", also translating to ""of nothing"" and used the same way."
Y_NS,"YENS.    	The word ""yen"", meaning ""urge"", has been around in English since the very early 1900s. It comes from the earlier word ""yin"" imported from Chinese, which was used in English to describe an intense craving for opium!"
_OSE,"ROSE.    	In William Shakespeare's play 'Romeo and Juliet', the lovers discuss the sad fact that they have been born into two feuding families in the famous balcony scene. Juliet says:"
_YE,"EYE.    	Argus Panoptes is a monster of Greek mythology. ""Panoptes"" means ""all-seeing"", so over time Argus has been described as having many, many eyes. Argus was noted for being alert, always keeping some eyes open when sleeping. This characteristic led to Argus being used for a vigilant person, and has been adopted as the name for many newspapers. After Argus died, Hera transferred his eyes to the tail of the peacock."
RE_,RET.    	Retired (ret.)
A_KS,"ARKS.    	The Torah ark is found in a synagogue, and is the ornamental container in which are stored the Torah scrolls."
LPG_,"LPGA.    	The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) was founded in 1950 by a group of 13 lady golfers, and today it is the oldest ongoing women's sports professional organization in the US."
LT_,"LTR.    	Our paper sizes here in North America don't conform with the standards in the rest of the world. ISO standard sizes used elsewhere were chosen so that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard size of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government. Prior to this, the ""legal"" size (8.5 x 14 inches) had been the standard, since 1921."
EC_N,"ECON.    	The Peace Prize is the most famous of the five prizes bequeathed by Alfred Nobel. The others are for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature. There is also a Nobel Prize in Economics that is awarded along with the original five, but it is funded separately and is awarded ""in memory of Alfred Nobel"". Four of the prizes are awarded by Swedish organizations (Alfred Nobel was a Swede) and so the award ceremonies take place in Stockholm. The Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and that award is presented in Oslo."
EDY_,"EDY'S.    	Dreyers' ice cream sells its products under the name Dreyers in the Western United States, and Edy's in the Eastern states. The company's founders were William Dreyer and Joseph Edy."
_SL,"YSL.    	Yves Saint-Laurent (YSL) was a French fashion designer, actually born in Algeria. Saint-Laurent started off working as an assistant to Christian Dior at the age of 17. Dior died just four years later, and as a very young man Saint-Laurent was named head of the House of Dior. However, in 1950 Saint-Laurent was conscripted into the French Army and ended up in a military hospital after suffering a mental breakdown from the hazing inflicted on him by his fellow soldiers. His treatment included electroshock therapy and administration of sedatives and psychoactive drugs. He was released from hospital, managed to pull his life back together and started his own fashion house. A remarkable story ..."
US_,"USO.    	The United Service Organization (USO) was founded in 1941 at the request of FDR ""to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces"". A USO tour is undertaken by a troupe of entertainers, many of whom are big-name celebrities. A USO tour usually includes troop locations in combat zones."
_GE,"AGE.    	AARP is the official name now for the interest group called the American Association of Retired Persons. The name change reflects the current focus of the group on all Americans aged 50 or over, as opposed to just people who have retired. The AARP was founded by Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus in 1958, and is a successor to the National Retired Teachers Association, also founded by Andrus over ten years earlier."
H_M,"HAM.    	The word ""ham"", describing a performer who overacts, is apparently a shortened form of ""hamfatter"" and dates back to the late 1800s. ""Hamfatter"" comes from a song in old minstrel shows called ""The Ham-Fat Man"". It seems that a poorly performing actor was deemed to have the ""acting"" qualities of a minstrel done up in black-face."
LA_R,"LAHR.    	Bert Lahr's most famous role was the cowardly lion in ""The Wizard of Oz"". Lahr had a long career in burlesque, vaudeville and on Broadway. Lahr also starred in the first US production of Samuel Beckett's play 'Waiting for Godot', alongside Tom Ewell."
U_B,"USB.    	Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an industry standard dealing with how computers and electronic devices connect and communicate, and deal with electrical power through those connections."
S_SHA,"SASHA.    	Sasha is the younger of the two Obama children, born in 2001. She is the youngest child to reside in the White House since John F. Kennedy, Jr. moved in with his parents as a small infant. Sasha's Secret Service codename is ""Rosebud"", and her older sister Malia has the codename ""Radiance""."
