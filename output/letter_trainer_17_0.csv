CFCs make their way up into the ozone layer and trigger a chain reaction that converts ozone (O3) into regular oxygen (O2). That conversion creates 'holes' in the ozone layer.

The modern GPS system that we use today was built by the military who received the massive funding needed because of fears during the Cold War of the use of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. We civilians, all round the world, owe a lot to President Ronald Reagan because he directed the military to make GPS available to the public for the common good.

_ST,"AST.    	Atlantic Standard Time is four hours behind Greenwich Mean Time, and one hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time.

OLE_,"OLES.    	Flamenco is a style of Spanish music and dance. The origin of the word ""flamenco"" isn't clearly understood, but the explanation that seems most credible to me is that it comes from Flanders in Northern Europe.

_EV,"NEV.    	Back in the 1800s, the Las Vegas Valley was given its name from the extensive meadows (""las vegas"" is Spanish for ""the meadows"") present in the area courtesy of the artesian wells drilled by local farmers.

It eventually became a railroad town, although with the coming of the railroad growth halted as travelers began to bypass Las Vegas. The city's tourism industry took off in 1935 with the completion of the nearby Hoover Dam, which is still a popular attraction. Then gambling was legalized, and things really started to move. Vegas was picked, largely by celebrated figures in ""the mob"", as a convenient location across the California/Nevada state line that could service the vast population of Los Angeles.

From ancient times right up to 1970, the annual flooding of the Nile was a significant event in Egypt.
