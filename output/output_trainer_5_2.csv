Actress Vardalos.   		3 letters,"NIA.    	Not only is the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", she also wrote the screenplay. The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history that didn't make it to number one. That record I think reflects the fact that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came when a spin-off TV show was launched called ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It ran for only 7 episodes."
