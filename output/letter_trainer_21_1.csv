CB_R,"CBER.    	A CBer is someone who operates a Citizens' Band radio. In 1945, the FCC set aside certain frequencies for the personal use of citizens. The use of the Citizens' Band increased right through the seventies as advances in electronics brought down the size of the transceivers and their cost. There aren't many CB radios sold these days though, as they have largely been replaced by cell phones."
HAM_,"HAMM.    	The twin brothers Paul and Morgan Hamm competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, representing the United States. Paul and Morgan won the silver medal in the team event, and Paul won the gold in the all-around competition."

Tommy Lee is also known for his two celebrated marriages, the first with Heather Locklear and the second with Pamela Anderson. The name 'Mötley Crüe' was chosen as the band members were called a 'motley looking crew'. The spelling was made to look a little more exotic, with the umlauts added over the 'o' and 'u' one day as the band was drinking bottles of Löwenbräu beer."
APHI_,"APHID.    	Aphids are called ""greenfly"" back in the British Isles where I come from. The most effective way to control aphids in my experience is to make sure there are plenty of ladybugs in the garden (called ladybirds in Ireland!)."
T_LESE,"TALESE.    	Gay Talese is an American author, famous for his days as a journalist in the sixties at ""The New York Times"". ""A Writer's Life"" is the second in series of three autobiographical books, published in 2006."

CI_,"CIO.    	The American Federation of Labor (AFL) was founded in 1886, making it one of the first federations of unions in the country. Over time the AFL became dominated by craft unions, unions representing skilled workers of particular disciplines. In the early thirties, John L. Lewis led a movement within the AFL to organize workers by industry, believing this would be more effective for the members. But the craft unions refused to budge, so Lewis set up a rival federation of unions in 1932 called the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The two federations became bitter rivals for over two decades until finally merging in 1955 to form the AFL-CIO."
A_PE,"ALPE.    	Mont Blanc, is the highest mountain in the Alps (or Alpes, in French). The name Mont Blanc translates into ""white mountain"". The mountain lies on the border between France and Italy, and it has been accepted for decades that the summit lies within French territory. However, there have been official claims that the summit does indeed fall within Italian territory."
ALIE_,"ALIEN.    	The 1979 sci-fi horror movie alien was the big break for Sigourney Weaver, as it was her first lead role, and her character ended up as central to a whole set of sequels. The movie's producers made a very conscious decision to cast a female in the lead role so as to have the film stand out in the male-dominated genre of science fiction."
_UIJA,"OUIJA.    	The Ouija board was introduced to America as a harmless parlor game at the end of the 19th century, although variations of the board date back to 1100 BC in China, where it was apparently used to ""contact"" the spirit world. The name ""Ouija"" is relatively recent, and is probably just a combination of the French and German words for ""yes"" ... ""oui"" and ""ja""."
REN_,RENU.    	ReNu is a brand name of contact lens products sold by Bausch & Lomb.
O_ILE,"ODILE.    	""Swan Lake"" is such a delightfully light and enjoyable ballet. It tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by a sorcerer. The ballet also features the Odile, Odette's ""evil twin"". Odile is disguised to look like Odette with the goal of tricking the prince to fall in love with her. In the ballet, the roles of Odette and Odile are played by the same ballerina."
_YSON,"TYSON.    	Cicely Tyson is an actor known for her performance in the film 'Sounder', for which she received an Oscar nomination. In the outstanding mini-series 'Roots', she played the role of Binta, Kunta Kinte's mother back in his homeland of Gambia."
T_BLE,"TABLE.    	These ""tabling"" and ""shelving"" idioms drive me crazy, because they are often misused. If a topic is shelved, it is set aside. If a topic is tabled, it is brought ""off the shelf"" and put 'on the table' for discussion. But, maybe it's just me ..."
_YR,AYR.    	Ayr is a port town on the Firth of Clyde in southwest Scotland. The famous poet Robert Burns was born just three miles from Ayr.
SE_,SEM.    	Father (the priest) was probably educated in a seminary.

During the bad old days of the ""Red Scare"", Ritt was working in television until he found himself on a blacklist for supposed support of Communist causes. He turned to the theater for work until the Red Scare had run its course, and them moved into the world of film. Some of his best known movies are ""The Great White Hope"" and ""Norma Rae""."
MAZD_,"MAZDA.    	I've always liked the looks of the Mazda Miata, probably because it reminds me so much of old British sports cars. The Miata is built in Hiroshima, Japan."
RH_NE,"RHINE.    	The Lorelie is a 300-foot tall rock on the eastern bank of the Rhine in Germany. The Lorelie juts out into the river creating a strong current as the water is forced through the narrows. The current combined with numerous rocks under the waterline have led to numerous boating accidents. Appropriately enough, Lorelei is the name of a legendary mermaid who lured fishermen to their death on the rocks by singing a beautiful song."
_TTLEE,"ATTLEE.    	Clement Attlee served as leader of Britain's Labour Party and as Deputy Prime Minister in the coalition government during the war years under the leadership of Winston Churchill, a Conservative. Attlee swept into power right after WWII in a landslide victory over Churchill and was responsible for major changes not only in Britain but around the waning British Empire. It was under Attlee that former British colonies like India, Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka and Jordan became independent. Also, the Palestine Mandate was terminated in 1948, while he was in office, with the state of Israel being declared the very next day."
U_UM,"UNUM.    	From 1776, 'E pluribus unum' was the unofficial motto of the United States. The phrase translates from Latin as 'Out of many, one'. It was pushed aside in 1956 when an Act of Congress designated 'In God We Trust' as the country's official motto. 'In God We Trust' had appeared on US coins since 1864, but was only introduced on paper currency in 1957."
_BER,"CBER.    	A CBer is someone who operates a Citizens' Band radio. In 1945, the FCC set aside certain radio frequencies for the personal use of citizens. The use of the Citizens' Band increased throughout the seventies as advances in electronics brought down the size of transceivers and their cost.

_ARTS,"DARTS.    	Darts is a wonderful game often played in British and Irish pubs, even over here in America. The scoring in a traditional game of darts is difficult to describe in a sentence or two, but the game of darts called ""Round the Clock"" is simply hitting the numbers 1 through 20 in sequence."
M_DMEN,"MAD MEN.    	If you haven't seen the AMC show ""Mad Men"" then I urge you to go buy the first season on DVD and allow yourself to get addicted. It is a great series set in the sixties, telling all that goes on in and around the advertising business on Madison Avenue in New York City. It brings you right back to the days of three-martini lunches, office affairs, and chain-smoking of cigarettes. Great stuff ..."
UL_AE,"ULNAE.    	The radius and ulna are bones in the forearm. If you hold the palm of your hand up in front of you, the radius is the bone on the ""thumb-side"" of the arm, and the ulna is the bone on the ""pinkie-side""."
ANNE_,"ANNE'S.    	What we call ""Queen Anne's Lace"" over here in the US is known by many in the British Isles as ""wild carrot"". The roots of Queen Anne's Lace are indeed edible, just like carrots, but only when they are very young because later in life they get very woody. The wild carrot was given the name Queen Anne's Lace when it was introduced into America as the flowers do resemble white lace. There is one small red flower in the center of the plant that is said to be a drop of blood that Queen Anne spilled when she pricked herself as she was making the lace."
RAY_,"RAYE.    	Martha Raye was a comic actress as well as a singer. Strangely enough, Raye was famous for the size of her mouth, something that she used to her own advantage. As her nickname was ""The Big Mouth"", she made a little money appearing in commercials for the Polident denture cleaner in the eighties. Her line was, ""So take it from the Big Mouth: new Polident Green gets tough stains clean!"""
O_ECK,"ORECK.    	The Oreck Corporation is named after founder David Oreck and is a manufacturer of vacuum cleaners and air purifiers. The company started out selling vacuum cleaners by mail, a new concept in 1963. David Oreck himself appears regularly as a spokesman in the company's ads and infomercials."
CU_,CUE.    	A pool shark carries a pool cue.
RO_I,"RONI.    	Rice-a-Roni was introduced in 1958 by the Golden Grain Macaroni Company of San Francisco. The company was run by an Italian immigrant and his four sons. The wife of one of the sons served a pilaf dish at a family diner that was a big hit, so her brother-in-law created a commercial version by blending dry chicken soup mix with rice and macaroni. Sounds like ""a San Francisco treat"" to me ..."
LOE_S,"LOESS.    	Loess is a wind-blown accumulation of silt. ""Loess"" is German in origin and was first used to describe silt along the Rhine Valley."
D_ET,"DEET.    	DEET is short for N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, an active ingredient in insect repellents. DEET is most often used to repel mosquitoes by applying it to the skin and/or clothing. It is also used to protect against tick bites."

T_S,"TVS.    	Samsung is huge multinational company based in Seoul, South Korea. We tend to think of Samsung as a supplier of consumer electronics perhaps, but the company is into so much more. Samsung Heavy Industries is the world's second-biggest shipbuilder, and Samsung Techwin is a major manufacturer of aeronautic and weapons systems. The name 'Samsung' means 'three stars' in Korean."
_EM,"SEM.    	Originally, a 'seminary' was where plants were raised from seeds, as 'semen' is the Latin for 'seed'. The first schools labelled as seminaries were established in the late 1500s. Those first schools were more likely to be academies for young ladies back then, rather than for trainee priests."
M_FIA,MAFIA.    	Apparently 'Cosa Nostra' is the real name for the Italian Mafia. 'Cosa Nostra' translates as 'our thing' or 'this thing of ours'. The term first became public in the US when the FBI managed to turn some members of the American Mafia. The Italian authorities established that 'Cosa Nostra' was also used in Sicily when they penetrated the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s. The term 'mafia' seems to be just a literary invention that has become popular with the public.
_OI,"MOI.    	The Muppet called Miss Piggy has a pretentious air, and so refers to herself as 'moi'. In 1998, Miss Piggy even released her own line of perfume called 'Moi'."

Cones on the other hand function in brighter light and can perceive color."
_AUM,"BAUM.    	In the 1939 movie 'The Wizard of Oz', Glinda is the Good Witch of the North, played by actress Billie Burke. As an aside, Burke was the wife of Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. who produced the 'Ziegfeld Follies' on Broadway. As another aside, Glinda wasn't the Good Witch of the North in the original L. Frank Baum book, but was the Good Witch of the South."
R_GIS,"REGIS.    	Regis Philbin is an amazingly popular television personality. Philbin is in such high demand and has had such a long career, that he holds the Guinness World Record for the most time spent in front of a television camera (in excess of 16,000 hours)."
B_NE,"BANE.    	Today we tend to use the word 'bane' to mean an anathema, a source of persistent annoyance. A few centuries ago, a bane was a cause of harm or death, perhaps a deadly poison."
_SIER,"OSIER.    	Most willows (trees and shrubs of the genus Salix) are called just that, willows. Some of the broad-leaved shrub varieties are called sallow, and the narrow-leaved shrubs are called osier."
C_O,"CIO.    	The American Federation of Labor was founded in 1886, making it one of the first federations of unions in the country.

A_MS,ATMS.    	Automated teller machine (ATM)
ROG_R,"ROGER.    	The term 'roger', meaning 'yes' or 'acknowledged', comes from the world of radio-telephony.

NIS_,"NISI.    	A decree nisi is a court order, one that only comes into force when certain specified conditions are met. At the point where the conditions are met, it becomes a decree absolute and is binding. 'Nisi' is Latin for 'unless'."

There is also a Nobel Prize in Economics that is awarded along with the original five, but it is funded separately and is awarded ""in memory of Alfred Nobel"". Four of the prizes are awarded by Swedish organizations (Alfred Nobel was a Swede) and so the award ceremonies take place in Stockholm. The Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and that award is presented in Oslo."
NINE_,"NINES.    	As in many sports competitions, diving is scored by giving marks out of ten."
AN_IC,"ANTIC.    	I suppose one could be forgiven for thinking that 'shenanigan' is an Irish term. Apparently the word is of uncertain derivation, coined in San Francisco and Sacramento, California in the mid-1800s."
J_IL,"JAIL.    	The street names in the US version of Monopoly are thoroughfares in or around Atlantic City, New Jersey."
_AMS,"RAMS.    	The St. Louis Rams has only won the Super Bowl once, in 1999, against the Tennessee Titans. The Rams were based in Cleveland from 1936-45, Los Angeles from 1946-94 and St. Louis from 1995 to the present day."

E_DO,ENDO-.    	An endotherm is an organism that generates heat internally. Humans are endotherms.
KI_I,"KIWI.    	Unlike many nicknames for people of a particular country, the name ""Kiwi"" for a New Zealander isn't offensive at all. The name comes from the flightless bird, the kiwi, that is endemic to New Zealand and is the country's national symbol. Kiwi is a Maori word, so the plural (when referring to the bird) is simply ""kiwi"". However, when you have two or more New Zealanders with you, they are Kiwis (note the ""s"", and indeed the capital ""K""!)."
RAY_,"RAYE.    	Martha Raye was a comic actress, as well as a singer. Strangely enough, Raye was famous for the size of her mouth, something that she used to her own advantage.

_AFFE,"GAFFE.    	Our word ""gaffe"" , meaning a social blunder, comes from the French word ""gaffe"" meaning ""clumsy remark"", although it originally was (and still is) the word for ""boat hook"". The exact connection between a boat hook and a blunder seems to be unclear."

A_AMIS,"ARAMIS.    	The ""Three Musketeers"" were Athos, Porthos and Aramis, and their young protégé was D'Artagnan. A musketeer was an infantry soldier who was equipped with a musket. Paradoxically, Alexander Dumas' ""Three Musketeers"" really didn't use their muskets, and were better known for their prowess with their swords."

RA_E,"RAVE.    	As you might imagine, I've never been to a rave, and don't have one upcoming in my diary. And as raves often start at 2 a.m. then I'm unlikely ever to experience one. A rave is generally an all-night party featuring loud, electronically-synthesized music usually played by a DJ as opposed to a live band."

_STAR,"S STAR.    	Red giants are very large stars with a relatively low mass. The atmosphere of a red giant is also very inflated and extends a long way into space so the surface of that atmosphere that we see is relatively cool, which gives it a red color.

Cool red giants are of a color beyond the usual range, and are classified as S stars."

It's a very satirical and irreverent piece though, so not something for everyone. It was banned in many countries, and even earned itself an X-rating in the UK (hard to do!). But the folks marketing the film used it to their advantage, using an advertising tag line of, ""So funny it was banned in Norway!"""
