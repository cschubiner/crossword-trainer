These two ingredients inspired the Pepsi Cola brand name that is used today."
JE_,"JEB.    	I always thought that Jeb was an American nickname for James or Joseph but I must be wrong, because George and Barbara's son John Ellis Bush is called ""Jeb"". A kind blog reader has suggested the the name ""Jeb"" may have been chosen as JEB are the initials of John Ellis Bush."

Of course these days, IEDs are very much in the news in Iraq and Afghanistan."
LAD_,"LADE.    	The verb ""lade"" meaning ""to load"" comes from an Old English word ""hladan"". Lade also used to mean ""to draw water"" and indeed gave us our word ""ladle"". So ""lade"" and ""ladle"" are close cousins."

Those first trees were placed in guildhalls and were decorated with sweets and candy for the apprentices and children.

The Christmas tree tradition was imported into Britain by the royal family because of its German heritage. That tradition spread from Britain into North America."

C_PRI,"CAPRI.    	Tiberius was the second Emperor of Rome, succeeding Augustus (himself the adopted son of Julius Caesar).

Y_S,"YDS.    	We never used the word ""gridiron"" when I was growing up in Ireland (meaning a grill used for cooking food over an open fire).

_LIE,"ILIE.    	I think that Ilie Nastase was the most entertaining tennis player of the 1970s, the days of Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe. No matter how much pressure there was in a match, Nastase always had time to give the crowd a laugh."

It was while resident in Wrexham that Yale responded to a request for financial support for the Collegiate School of Connecticut in 1701. He sent the school a donation, which was used to erect a new building in New Haven that was named 'Yale' in his honor. In 1718, the whole school was renamed to 'Yale College'.

In the US, alcoholic proof is twice the alcohol by volume (ABV), and ABV is simply the volume of alcohol in a the beverage compared to its total volume, and expressed as a percentage. Therefore a liquor that is 50% ABV, is 100 proof. The concept of ""proof"" dates back to the days of British sailors being paid partly with rations of rum. A ""proof spirit"" was the most dilute spirit that would sustain combustion of gunpowder. Simply stated, if the rum that a sailor was given was so dilute that it doused burning gunpowder, then it was unacceptable to the sailor. The person providing the rum had to give ""proof"" that the rum would catch light, proving it was strong enough to be used as payment. It was found experimentally that rum of 57.15% ABV was the lowest concentration that could sustain a flame, so this was named as 100 degrees proof. But nowadays we round down to 50% ABV."

The capital city of Freetown was originally set up as a colony to house the 'Black Poor' of London, England.
