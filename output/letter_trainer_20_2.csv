W_E,WIE.    	Michelle Wie is an American golfer on the LPGA Tour. Wie began playing golf at the age of four and was the youngest player ever to qualify for an LPGA tour event. She turned pro just before her 16th birthday ...
CLA_,"CLAM.    	'Buck' and 'clam' are both slang terms for 'a dollar'. The term 'buck' has been around at least since 1856, and is thought to derive from the tradition of using buckskin as a unit of trade with Native Americans during the frontier days. It has been suggested that 'clam' has a similar derivation, a throwback to the supposed use of clams as units of currency in ancient cultures."
PC_S,"PCBS.    	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were banned with good reason. Apart from their link to cancer and other disorders in humans and animals, they are extremely persistent in the environment once contamination has occurred. Among other things, PCBs were used as coolants and insulating fluids in electrical gear such as transformers and large capacitors, as well as a transfer agent in carbonless copy paper."
ES_,"ESQ.    	The title ""esquire"" is of British origin and is used differently today depending on whether one is in the US or the UK. Here in America the term is usually reserved for those practicing the law (both male and female).

_ATE,"MATE.    	In the game of chess, when the king is under immediate threat of capture it is said to be ""in check"". If the king cannot escape from check, then the game ends in ""checkmate"" and the player in check loses. In the original Sanskrit game of chess, the king could actually be captured. Then a rule was introduced requiring that a warning be given if capture was imminent (today we announce ""check!"") so that an accidental and early ending to the game doesn't occur."

_AIKU,"HAIKU.    	A haiku is a very elegant form of Japanese verse. When writing a haiku in English we tend to impose the rule that the verse must contain 17 syllables. This restriction comes from the rule in Japanese that the verse must contain 17 sound units called ""moras"", but moras and syllables aren't the same thing. What the difference is though, is not so clear to me. Here's an example of a Haiku:"
ES_ANA,"ESPANA.    	The famous surrealist painter Salvador Dalí was born in Figueres, Spain. I had the privilege of visiting the Dalí Museum in Figueres some years ago, just north of Barcelona.

_FTS,"EFTS.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."
E_Q,"ESQ.    	The title ""esquire"" is of British origin and is used differently today depending on whether one is in the US or the UK. Here in America the term is usually reserved for those practicing the law (both male and female).

Unlike her father, Mary adhered to her Roman Catholic faith and was noted for her brutal persecution of Protestants during her reign. She had almost three hundred religious dissenters burned at the stake, resulting in her gaining the nickname 'Bloody Mary'. Roman Catholic rule was reversed after she died, when her half-sister Elizabeth I succeeded to the throne."
R_DAR,"RADAR.    	Scientists have been using radio waves to detect the presence of objects since the late 1800s, but it was the demands of WWII that accelerated the practical application of the technology.

N_IR,"NAIR.    	Nair is a hair removal product that has some pretty harsh ingredients. The most important active constituents are calcium hydroxide (""slake lime"") and sodium hydroxide (""caustic soda""). Other Nair components seem to be there to soothe the skin after the harsher chemicals have done their job. The name ""Nair"" probably comes from combining ""no"" and ""hair""."
PRI_M,"PRISM.    	When light passes through a prism, it is split up ('disperses') into differing wavelengths. It then becomes clear that white light is actually a mixture of different colors, which show up as beautiful spectra."

BMW was making aircraft engines during WWI, but had to cease that activity according to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The company started making motorcycles, and then moved into automobile production starting in 1928. BMW moved back into aircraft engine manufacturing during the build-up of the Luftwaffe prior to WWII."
TI_AN,"TITAN.    	Titan is the largest moon of Saturn. Titan is unusual in many ways, including the fact that it is the only known satellite in the solar system that is has its own atmosphere (our own moon does not, for example). Titan is the second largest moon in the solar system, after Ganymede that orbits Jupiter. Titan is so large that it has a greater volume than Mercury, the solar system's smallest planet."
U_AUL,"U-HAUL.    	The U-Haul company was started by married couple Leonard Shoen and Anna Mary Carty in Ridgefield, Washington in 1945.

There are now about 15,000 U-Hail dealers across the country."
DEE_,"DEER.    	The phrase 'humble pie' derives from a medieval meat dish called 'umble pie'. The filling in unble pie usually contained the offal (heart, liver, lungs and kidneys) of deer. The name 'umble' came from the French 'nomble' meaning 'deer's innards'."

ADON_S,"ADONIS.    	In Greek mythology, Adonis is a beautiful young god loved by Aphrodite. Adonis dies in a hunting accident (gored by a boar), but not before he gives Aphrodite a child. Adonis was originally a Phoenician god ""absorbed"" into Greek lore (Phoenicia is modern day Lebanon).

NAA_P,"NAACP.    	The full name of the NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, is remarkable in that it actually still uses the offensive term 'colored people'. The NAACP was founded in 1909, by a group that included suffragette and journalist Mary White Ovington, wealthy socialist William English Walling, and civil rights activist Henry Moscowitz. Another member of the founding group was W. E. B. Du Bois, the first African-American to earn a doctorate at Harvard University. The date chosen for the founding of the NAACP was February 12th, 1909, the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln, the man most visibly associated with the emancipation of African-American slaves."

_DI,"SDI.    	One of the positive outcomes of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a change in US defense strategy. The new approach was to use missiles to destroy incoming hostile weapons, rather than using missiles to destroy the nation attacking the country. The former doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction went by the apt acronym of MAD ..."
D_ER,"DEER.    	The 1942 Disney classic ""Bambi"" is based on a book written by Felix Salten called ""Bambi, A Life in the Woods"".

CRA_,CRAB.    	'Cancer' is the Latin word for 'crab'.
_RK,"ORK.    	""Mork & Mindy"" was broadcast from 1978 to 1982. We were first introduced to Mork (played by Robin Williams, of course) in a special episode of ""Happy Days"". The particular episode in question has a bizarre storyline culminating in Fonzie and Mork having a thumb-to-finger duel. Eventually Richie wakes up in bed, and alien Mork was just part of a dream! Oh, and ""Nanu Nanu"" means both ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" back on the planet Ork. ""I am Mork from Ork, Nanu Nanu"". Great stuff ..."

BL_U,"BLEU.    	Being a bit of a French speaker (admittedly a pretty poor one, and a grumpy one), the term ""bleu"" cheese has always kind of irritated me. I would prefer that we use either ""blue cheese"" or ""fromage bleu"" and not mix the languages, but then I can be annoyingly picky! It's said that blue cheese was probably discovered accidentally, as molds tend to develop in the same conditions that are best for storing cheese. The blue mold in the cheese is introduced by adding Penicillium spores before the cheese is allowed to set. And yes, it's the same mold that is used to produce penicillin, the antibiotic."
TRYS_S,"TRYSTS.    	In its most general sense, a tryst is a meeting at an agreed time and place. More usually we consider a tryst to be a prearranged meeting between lovers. The term comes from the Old French 'triste', a waiting place designated when hunting."

During the run up (pun intended!) to the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Torre carried the Olympic flame part of the way through Florence in Italy, handing it over to the next runner at the famous Ponte Vecchio. I'd guess that was quite a thrill for him ..."
_OT,"POT.    	A leprechaun is a mischievous fairy in Irish folklore. Traditionally, leprechauns spend their days making shoes and hide all their money in a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Our word 'leprechaun' comes from the Irish name for such a sprite, 'leipreachán'."
K_DD,"KIDD.    	William Kidd was a Scottish privateer who went by the name 'Captain Kidd'.

There is common opinion held today that the charges against Kidd were actually trumped up."

S_AP,"SNAP.    	Snap, Crackle and Pop are three elves employed as the mascots for Kellogg's Rice Krispies. The trio first appeared in an ad campaign in 1933, although the phrase ""snap, crackle and pop"" had been used for the cereal for some time in radio ads. By the way, the elves are selling ""Rice Bubbles"" in Australia, and the elves have different names in other parts of the world (like ""Cric!, Crac! and Croc! in Quebec)."
BAR_,BART.    	Bart Giamatti was the President of Yale University from 1978 to 1986. He was also the Commissioner of Major League Baseball for a few months in 1989 after having served as National League President from 1986 to 1989.

The second part of the park is the Kipahulu section, which features the very picturesque pools accessed along the Road to Hana. When we visited (quite a few years ago), the Road to Hana was a tad undeveloped and rental car companies would not allow you to drive their cars there. Funnily enough, the only cars you'd meet on the Road to Hana were rental cars ..."
_LMS,"ELMS.    	Elms College, more correctly called the College of Our Lady of the Elms, is a Catholic college located in Chicopee, Massachusetts. The school was founded as a girls' preparatory academy in 1897. Elms College became co-educational in 1998."

H_SH,"HASH.    	""Hash"", meaning a dish of beef and vegetables mashed together, is a very American term and one that really surprised me when I first came across it. ""Hash"" just seems like such an unappetizing item, but I soon found out how delicious it was. The name ""hash"" in this context comes from the French ""hacher"" meaning ""to chop"". Back in the early 1900s the dish called ""hashed browned potatoes"" was developed, which quickly morphed into ""hash browns"". From there the likes of corned beef hash was introduced."

The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, so it's all just a great story as opposed to documentary.

A US printing house finally took on the project in 1958, by which time the title had such a reputation that it sold exceptionally quickly.

The pass of Thermopylae was so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time.

The official use of 'United Kingdom' originated in 1707 with the Acts of Union that declared the countries of England and Scotland as 'United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain'. The name changed again with the Acts of Union 1800 that created the 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland' (much to the chagrin of most of the Irish population).

PIP_,"PIPE.    	Most sinks in a home have a P-trap in the outlet pipe that empties into the sewer line. This P-trap has at its heart a U-bend that retains a small amount of water after the sink is emptied. This plug of water serves as a seal to prevent sewer gases entering into the home. By virtue of its design, the U-bend can also capture any heavy objects (like an item of jewelry) that might fall through the plughole.

Even though balsa wood is very soft, it is actually classified as a hardwood, the softest of all the hardwoods (go figure!). Balsa is light and strong, so is commonly used in making model airplanes.

Although ""Lolita"" is considered a classic today, after Nabokov finished it in 1953 the edgy subject matter made it impossible for him to find a publisher in the US (where Nabokov lived). In 1955, he resorted to publishing it in English at a printing house in Paris. Publication was followed by bans and seizures all over Europe. A US printing house finally took on the project in 1958, by which time the title had such a reputation that it sold exceptionally quickly. ""Lolita"" became the first book since ""Gone with the Wind"" to sell over 100,000 copies in its first three weeks in stores."
