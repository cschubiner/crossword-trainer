Brando wasn't the first person to refuse an Oscar. George C. Scott did the same thing when he won for playing the title role in 1970's ""Patton"".

S*P*Y*_,"S*P*Y*S.    	""S*P*Y*S"" is a 1974 comedy starring Elliott Gould and Donald Sutherland as two men mistaken as spies and targeted by the KGB.

Such acceleration can cause blood to pool in the lower part of the body, reducing the supply to the brain and possibly leading to a black-out.

Ms. Eisenhower suffered from an inner ear complaint called Ménière's disease which caused her to lose her balance quite often. Because she was unsteady on her feet there were unfounded rumors floating around Washington that Ms. Eisenhower had a drinking problem. People can be very unkind ...

SP_MS,"SPAMS.    	I think it may be true that the term SPAM for unwanted email is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch, the dialog is taken over by the word SPAM, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets in Britain after WWII. So SPAM is a term for emails that take over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon."

OH_NRY,"O HENRY.    	The O. Henry Award has been given annually since 1919 and honors exceptional short stories. 'O. Henry' was the pen name of writer William Sydney Porter from Greensboro, North Carolina. O. Henry is famous for his witty short stories that have a clever twist in the tail."
S_INTO,"SHINTO.    	It might perhaps be best not to describe Shinto as a religion, but more as a spirituality of the Japanese people that encompasses folklore, history and mythology. Having said that, ""Shinto"" translates literally as ""Way of the Gods"". Most people in Japan described as practicing Shinto, also practice Buddhism."
_NION,"ANION.    	As we all recall from science class, a positive ion is called a cation and a negative ion is an anion. The names ""cation"" and ""anion"" come from Greek, with ""kation"" meaning ""going down"" and ""anion"" meaning ""going up""."
ED_NS,"EDENS.    	The word Utopia was coined by Sir Thomas More for his book ""Utopia"" published in 1516, describing an idyllic fictional island in the Atlantic Ocean. More's use of the name Utopia comes from the Greek ""ou"" meaning ""not"" and ""topos"" meaning ""place"". By calling his perfect island ""Not Place"", More was apparently making the point that he didn't think that the ideal could actually exist."
_EP,"HEP.    	The slang term ""hep"" meaning ""cool"" has the same meaning as the later, derivative term ""hip"". The origins of ""hep"" seem unclear, but it was adopted by jazz musicians of the early 1900s."

Jesse's real name was James Cleveland Owens, and he went by ""JC"" as a child. However, his Alabama accent was misconstrued at school when his family moved to Cleveland, so teachers and classmates called him ""Jesse"" instead of ""JC"", and the name stuck."
AL_EN,"ALLEN.    	Allen Iverson is a professional basketball player who played in the NBA for several years. Iverson currently plays for a team in Turkey, would you believe?"
PO_T,"PORT.    	The left side of a ship used to be called the ""larboard"" side, but this was dropped in favor of ""port"" as pronunciation of larboard was easily confused with ""starboard"", the right side of the vessel. The term ""port"" was chosen as it was customary to dock a ship, for loading in port, with the left side of the vessel against the dock."
U_LS,URLS.    	Internet addresses (like NYTCrossword.com) are Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).

AZAL_A,"AZALEA.    	Azaleas are very toxic to horses, sheep and goats, but strangely enough cause no problem for cats or dogs. And if you go to Korea you might come across ""Tugyonju"", which is azalea wine made from the plant's blossoms."

H_BACHI,"HIBACHI.    	The traditional hibachi in Japan is a heating device, often a ceramic bowl or box that holds burning charcoal.

VE_AS,"VEGAS.    	Las Vegas, Nevada was founded as a city in 1905. It became a stop-off point for pioneers travelling west, and eventually a railroad town, although with the coming of the railroad growth halted, as folks began to bypass Las Vegas. The city's tourism industry took off in 1935 with the completion of the nearby Hoover Dam, and visitors to Vegas take tours of the dam to this day. Then gambling was legalized, and things really started to move. Vegas was picked, largely by celebrated figures in ""the mob"", as a convenient location across the California/Nevada state line that could service the vast population of Los Angeles. As a result, Las Vegas became the most populous US city founded in the 20th century (an honor that went to Chicago in the 19th century)."
RO_K,"ROOK.    	The corner piece in the game of chess is a called a rook, a word coming from the Persian word ""rokh"" meaning a ""chariot"". It has also been called, perhaps incorrectly, a castle, tower, marquess and rector."

WOK_,"WOKS.    	Wok is a Cantonese word, the name of the frying pan now used in many Asian cuisines."
_CG,"ECG.    	An EKG measures electrical activity in the heart. Back in my homeland of Ireland, an EKG is known as an ECG (for electrocardiogram). We use the German name in the US, Elektrokardiogramm, giving us EKG. Apparently the abbreviation EKG is preferred as ECG might be confused (if poorly handwritten, I guess) with EEG, the abbreviation for an electroencephalogram."
COC_A,COCOA.    	A chocolate truffle takes its name from its shape. 'Truffle' has Latin roots and comes from the word for 'lump'.

JE_S,"JETS.    	The first jet to be called a ""Jumbo"" was Boeing's 747, as it was the original wide-body airliner, meaning it was the first to have seating laid out with two aisles running the length of the plane.

ALE_S,"ALECS.    	Alec Baldwin is the oldest of the acting Baldwin brothers. I think Alec's big break was playing Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan in ""The Hunt for Red October"", but thank goodness that role was taken over by Harrison Ford for the subsequent Jack Ryan movies. Baldwin is making a name for himself these days playing Jack Donaghy on ""30 Rock"", opposite Tina Fey."

Every cell ""knows"" how to make a whole human being. This fact is exploited when taking certain cells for cloning, creating new identical replicates of the original animal from which the donor cell was taken."
LE_ITBE,"LET IT BE.    	""Let It Be"" was the last song that the Beatles released as an active group, playing together. The song was written by Paul McCartney, and is clearly one of his own favorites. He says that he was inspired to write the song after having had a dream about his mother (who had died some years earlier from cancer). In fact, in the line ""Mother Mary comes to me"", the reference is to his mother, Mary McCartney nee Mohan. Paul's second wife, Linda, is singing backing vocals on the song, the only time she is known to have done so in a Beatles recording. 18 years after that 1970 recording was made, Paul, George and Ringo sang ""Let It Be"" at a memorial service for Linda, who was also lost to cancer. Morbid stuff, but a lovely song ..."
Z_NO,"ZENO.    	Zeno of Elea was a Greek philosopher, who lived in Elea, a Greek colony in Southern Italy. He is famous for his 'paradoxes', a set of problems that really make you think! In the problem known as Achilles and the Tortoise, Zeno tells us that Achilles races a tortoise, giving the tortoise a head start (of say 100 meters). By the time Achilles reaches the starting point of the tortoise, the tortoise will have moved on, albeit only a small distance. Achilles then sets his sight on the tortoise's new position and runs to it. Again the tortoise has moved ahead a little. Achilles keeps on moving to the tortoise's new position, but can never actually catch his slower rival, or can he ...?"
S_OG,"SNOG.    	I never thought I'd ever see the word ""snog"" in a crossword! It's equivalent to the American term ""making out"" as in ""kissing and cuddling"", but it's considered pretty rude in the land of Harry Potter I'd say."
LE_TAT,"LESTAT.    	Anne Rice is an American author of erotic and Gothic novels, and was born Howard Allen O'Brien (no wonder she changed her name!). Her series of novels ""The Vampire Chronicles"" centers on her character Lestat de Lioncourt, a French nobleman who was turned into a vampire in the 18th century. One of the stories, ""Interview with the Vampire"" was adapted for the big screen in 1994, and features Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and others in a star-studded cast. Not my kind of movie though. I don't do vampires ..."

_YES,"LYES.    	Today, when we purchase what is labelled as ""lye"", it is caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). To clean out drains we might buy Crystal Drano which is sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that that mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."

The Blackhawks were one of the 17 original teams playing at the founding of the National Basketball Association.

G_DOT,"GODOT.    	An Irishman I may be, but I have sat through so many Samuel Beckett plays (the Irish dramatist) and have yet to come away feeling satisfied that I spent my time well.

_NRED,"ON RED.    	If you're sitting behind a car that doesn't make a right on red, it may just be a rental car driven by someone from Europe. Speaking as someone who learned to drive over there, I must admit I held up a few people at red lights when I first visited this country. That's because in Europe we aren't allowed to make any move past a red light, unless there is an accompanying green arrow. So, if you're driving over there, take care ..."

Skype has other features such as video conferencing and instant messaging, but the application made its name from voice communication. Skype was founded by two Scandinavian entrepreneurs and the software necessary was developed by a team of engineers in Estonia. The development project was originally called ""Sky peer-to-peer"" that gave birth to the name ""Skyper"", which had to be shortened to ""Skype"" because the skyper.com domain name was already in use."
_ELEB,"CELEB.    	The title of the celebrated 1960 Federico Fellini film ""La Dolce Vita"" translates from Italian as ""The Good Life"".

RAREB_T,"RAREBIT.    	Welsh rarebit is a delicious dish made using a cheese-flavored sauce served over toast. It may be that the name Welsh rarebit was originally a bit of an insult to the folks in Wales. The dish was called Welsh ""rabbit"" back in the 1700s.

L_TITBE,"LET IT BE.    	""Let It Be"" was the last album that the Beatles released as an active group playing together. The title song 'Let It Be' was written by Paul McCartney, and is clearly one of his own favorites. McCartney says that he was inspired to write the song after having had a dream about his mother (who had died some years earlier from cancer). In fact he refers to her (Mary McCartney) in the line ""Mother Mary comes to me"". Paul's second wife, Linda, is singing backing vocals on the song, the only time she is known to have done so in a Beatles recording. 18 years after that 1970 recording was made, Paul, George and Ringo sang ""Let It Be"" at a memorial service for Linda, who was also lost to cancer. Sad stuff, but a lovely song ..."

Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to continue his work as a revolutionary. He was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967, and was executed.

It was published on the front page of a leading Paris newspaper, and accused the government of anti-Semitism in its handling of the trial of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Dreyfus was a Jewish military officer in the French army, falsely accused and convicted of spying for Germany. Even after the error was discovered, the government refused to back down, choosing to let Dreyfus rot away on Devil's Island rather than admit to the mistake.

The second, more famous attempt (in 1926), involved Moran and a fleet of cars driving by Capone's hotel and spraying the lobby in which he was standing. Again, Capone escaped unharmed.

NE_SON,"NEESON.    	Irish actor Liam Neeson plays the lead role of Jean Valjean in the 1998 screen adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel ""Les Miserables"".

KH_N,"KHAN.    	When ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" came out in 1982 it set a world record for first-day sales of movie tickets, despite the fact that the preceding ""Star Trek"" film was viewed as a critical and commercial flop. William Shatner of course played James T. Kirk, and the evil Khan was played by Ricardo Montalbán.

LYE_,"LYES.    	Historically, lye was hydrated potash (potassium hydroxide). Nowadays when we purchase lye it caustic soda (sodium hydroxide). Crystal Drano was developed in 1932 by one Harry Drackett, who produced the product in his own company until it was bought over in 1965 by Bristol Myers. The crystalline form of Drano is sodium hydroxide (lye) as well as sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The product works as the lye reacts with any fats in the clog forming soap. The lye also reacts with finely divided aluminum generating tremendous heat, creating boiling and churning so that any hair or other deposits are cut by the sharp edges of the crystals.
