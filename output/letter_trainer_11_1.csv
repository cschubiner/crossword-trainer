Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is found in nature in small amounts Carbon-14 is used in the technique known as radiocarbon dating, a relatively accurate way of determining the age of something up to about 60,000 years old. When an organism is alive, the amount of radioactive carbon-14 it has compared to the amount of regular carbon-12, is a fixed ratio. After the organism dies, it is no longer exchanging carbon with the atmosphere through metabolism. So, the stable carbon-12 stays in the body as it rots but the radioactive carbon-14 gradually decays, causing the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 to fall. Scientists can determine the age of remains by measuring this carbon-14/carbon-12 ratio."

He is remembered annually here in California on his birthday, March 31, a state holiday."
_OMA,"MOMA.    	The founding of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City was very much driven by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the wife of John D. Rockefeller, son of the oil magnate. Working with two friends, Abby managed to get the museum opened in 1929, just nine days after the Wall Street Crash. The MoMA's sculpture garden bears the name of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, and has done so since 1949."
I_OD,"IPOD.    	The iPod is Apple's signature line of portable media players. The iPod first hit the market in 2001 with a hard drive-based device, now known as the iPod Classic.

SIA_,"SIAM.    	""Anna and the King of Siam"" is a semi-biographical novel written by Margaret Landon and first published in 1944. The book tells the largely true story of Anna Leonowens who spent five years in Siam teaching English to the children and wives of King Mongkut. The novel was adapted as a 1946 movie of the same name starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison. Then followed a 1951 stage musical titled 'The King and I'. The musical was written as a vehicle for Gertrude Lawrence, who played Anna. Rex Harrison was asked to play the King, but he turned it down and Yul Brynner was cast instead. A movie version of the stage musical was released in 1956, famously starring Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr."
_PR,"CPR.    	Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has for decades involved the simultaneous compression of the chest to pump blood using the heart, and artificial respiration by blowing air into the lungs. Nowadays emergency services are placing more emphasis on heart compressions, and less on artificial respiration."
VE_,"VEE.    	One has to be careful making that V-sign depending where you are in the world. Where I came from, the V for victory (or peace) sign has to be made with the palm facing outwards. If the sign is made with the palm facing inwards, it's a very obscene gesture."
AENE_D,"AENEID.    	""The Aeneid"" is Virgil's epic poem that tells of the journey of Aeneas, a Trojan who traveled to Italy to become the ancestor of all Romans. 'The Aeneid' begins with the words 'Arma virumque cano ...', which translates as 'I sing of arms and of a man ...'"

OC_,"OCT.    	October is the tenth month in our calendar but was the eighth month in the old Roman calendar, hence the name 'Octo-ber'. Back then there were only ten months in the year. 'Ianuarius' (January) and 'Februarius' were then added as the eleventh and twelfth months of the year. Soon after, the year was reset and January and February became the first and second months."

A_E,"AGE.    	The drinking age in the US is defined by state, however, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 in effect sets the standard across the country at 21. If any state chooses to allow drinking at an age below 21, it loses revenue from the federal government."
N_L,"NFL.    	We never used the word ""gridiron"" when I was growing up (meaning a grill used for cooking food over an open fire). So, maybe I am excused for finding out fairly recently that a football field gridiron is so called because the layout of yard lines over the field looks like a gridiron used in cooking!"
_AX,"SAX.    	The saxophone was invented by Belgian, Adolphe Sax. Sax developed lip cancer at one point in his life, and one has to wonder if that was related to his saxophone playing (I am sure not!). I had the privilege of visiting his grave in the Cemetery of Montmartre in Paris a few years ago."
_SA,"BSA.    	As every little boy (of my era) knows, the Scouting movement was founded by Lord Baden Powell, in 1907. The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) soon followed, in 1910. And, the Boy Scouts motto is 'Be Prepared'."

S_RI,"SIRI.    	Siri is software application that works with Apple's iOS operating system. 'Siri' is an acronym standing for Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface. You've probably seen the ads on television, with folks talking to their iPhones asking for information and responding with a voice. I hear that Google is a little scared by Siri, as Siri is non-visual. There's no need to touch a screen or a keyboard to work with Siri, no opportunity to click on one of Google's ads! By the way, voice-over artist Susan Bennett recently revealed herself as the female American voice of Siri. The British version of Siri is called Daniel, and the Australian version is called Karen. By the way, 'Siri' is a Norwegian name meaning 'beautiful woman who leads you to victory', and was the name the developer had chosen for his first child."

Many famous Olympic athletes have participated in the Maccabiah Games, including the swimmer Mark Spitz and the gymnast Kerri Strug."
REE_,"REED.    	The crumhorn is a woodwind instrument that was very popular during the Renaissance. The name comes from the German ""Krumhorn"" meaning ""bent horn"", which adequately describes the instrument's shape, somewhat like the letter ""J"". As it is a woodwind, the sound is produced by blowing air past a reed, in fact a double-reed in the case of a crumhorn."
ANT_,"ANTS.    	Most nettle species have stinging hairs that secrete formic acid. This formic acid is the same chemical that is found in the venom injected with a bee or ant sting. The Latin word for ant is ""formica"" and gives its name to the acid."

_AC,"MAC.    	Steve Jobs certainly was a business icon in Silicon Valley. I don't think it is too surprising to learn that the brilliant Jobs didn't even finish his college education, dropping out of Reed College in Oregon after only one semester. Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976, but in 1985 he was basically fired from his own company during the computer sales slump of the mid-eighties. Jobs then founded NeXT Computer, a company focused on supplying workstations to the higher education and business markets.

The company was founded by a carpenter called Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1934 and the now-famous plastic interlocking blocks were introduced in 1949. The blocks were originally sold under the name ""Automatic Binding Bricks"" but I think ""Lego"" is easier to remember! The name ""Lego"" comes from the Danish term ""leg godt"" meaning ""play well""."
_NED,"ONE-D.    	The dimension of an object is defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify each point in the object. A line, therefore, is one-dimensional as you only need an x-coordinate to specify a particular point on the line. A surface is two-dimensional, as you need both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate to locate a point on the surface. The inside of a solid object is then three-dimensional, needing an x-, y- and z-coordinate to specify a point, say within a cube."
DI_A,"DIVA.    	""Diva"" comes to us from Latin via Italian. ""Diva"" is the feminine form of ""divus"" meaning ""divine one"".

Sax developed lip cancer at one point in his life, and one has to wonder if his affliction was related to his saxophone playing (I am sure not!). I had the privilege of visiting Sax's grave in the Cemetery of Montmartre in Paris a few years ago."
A_ORA,"AGORA.    	In early Greece the agora was a place of assembly. Often the assemblies held there were quite formal, perhaps for the reading of a proclamation. Later in Greek history, things became less formal as the agora evolved into a market place. Our contemporary word ""agoraphobia"" comes from these agorae, in the sense that a sufferer has a fear of open spaces, a fear of ""public meeting places""."
N_L,"NFL.    	The NFL had a Dallas Texan team for just one season, back in 1952. The Texans were one of the worst teams in NFL history, finishing that one season with a record of 1-11. The one win was in the Rubber Bowl at the end of the season played against the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving Day. The game was played in front of only 3,000 spectators, with the Bears only fielding their second-string team."

YVE_,"YVES.    	Jacques Cousteau was French, and ""mer"" is the French word for ""sea"". Jacques-Yves Cousteau started off his career in the French Navy, heading for a working life in aviation. Because of a car accident, he had to abandon that objective, and instead went to sea. Famously, he invented the aqualung, and is the father of SCUBA diving."
NO_,"NOM.    	In France, one will see a person's name (nom) on his or her passport (passeport)."
STL_,"ST LO.    	Saint-Lô is a town in Normandy that was occupied by Germany in 1940. Saint-Lo stood at a strategic crossroads and so there was intense fighting there during the Normandy invasion of 1944. After the bombardment, very little of the town was left standing."

OR_OS,"OREOS.    	The Oreo was the best-selling cookie in the 20th century, and almost 500 billion of them have been sold since they were introduced in 1912 by Nabisco. In those early days the creme filling was made with pork fat, but today vegetable oils are used instead. If you take a bite out of an Oreo sold outside of America you might notice a difference from the homegrown cookie, as coconut oil is added in the overseas version to give a different taste."
NB_,NBC.    	Comcast is the largest cable company in the United States. Comcast was founded in 1963 as American Cable systems.
ALI_E,"ALICE.    	Lewis Carroll wrote ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" in 1865, and the sequel called ""Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There"" in 1871. Because in the second adventure Alice went through a looking glass, the themes were deliberately chosen to be mirror images of the themes in ""Wonderland"". Whereas ""Wonderland"" begins indoors, is set in summer, and uses playing card imagery, ""Looking Glass"" begins out of doors, is set in winter and uses images from the game of chess."
NA_A,"NALA.    	In ""The Lion King"", Nala is a lioness, the childhood friend of Simba."
_OP,"OOP.    	""Alley Oop"" is a comic strip that ran for four decades starting in 1932. ""Alley Oop"" was drawn by V. T. Hamlin. The title character lived in the prehistoric kingdom of Moo, although for much of the strip's life, Alley Oop had access to a time machine. Alley Oop also had a girlfriend called Ooola.

_EL,"TEL.    	Armana is an archaeological site on the east bank of the Nile River in Egypt, almost 200 miles south of Cairo. The ancient city is also known as el-Armana, and Tel el-Armana, although the use of ""Tel"" is apparently incorrect. ""Tel"" commonly appears in names in the region (Arabic for ""hill"") but should not apply to Amarna as the site is perfectly flat."
_NOLA,"ENOLA.    	As we all know, the Enola Gay was the B-29 that dropped the first atomic bomb, on Hiroshima in August 1945. Enola Gay was the name of the mother of the pilot, Col. Paul W. Tibbets, Jr."

Cleopatra observed such executions noting that the venom brought on sleepiness without any painful spasms. When the great queen opted to commit suicide, the asp was therefore her chosen method."
O_ARE,"O'HARE.    	O'Hare International is the fourth busiest airport in the world. The original airport was constructed on the site between 1942 and 1943, and was used by the Douglas Aircraft Company for the manufacture of planes during WWII. Before the factory and airport were built, there was a community in the area called Orchard Place, so the airport was called Orchard Place Airport/Douglas Field. This name is the derivation of the airport's current location identifier: ORD (OR-chard D-ouglas). Orchard Place Airport was renamed to O'Hare International in 1949 in honor of Lieutenant Commander Edward O'Hare who grew up in Chicago. O'Hare was the US Navy's first flying ace and a Medal of Honor recipient in WWII. As an aside, Edward O'Hare's father was a lawyer for Al Capone who helped get the famous gangster convicted on tax evasion."
ANN_,"ANNO.    	The designations Anno Domini (AD, 'year of Our Lord') and Before Christ (BC) are found in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The dividing point between AD and BC is the year of the conception of Jesus, with AD 1 following 1 BC without a year '0' in between. The AD/BC scheme dates back to AD 525, and gained wide acceptance soon after AD 800.

LAUR_,"LAURA.    	Otto Preminger was noted for his films that pushed the envelope in terms of subject matter, at least in the fifties and sixties. Great examples would be 1955's ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" that dealt with drug addiction, 1959's ""Anatomy of a Murder"" that dealt with rape, and 1962's ""Advise and Consent"" that dealt with homosexuality. If you've seen these films, you'll have noticed that the references are somewhat indirect and disguised, in order to get past the censors."

Golda Meir was born Golda Mabovitch in Kiev (in modern-day Ukraine), and when she was a young girl she moved with her family to the United States and settled in Milwaukee. As a teenager she relocated to Denver where she met and married Morris Meyerson, at the age of 19. She and her husband joined a kibbutz in Palestine in 1921, when she was in her twenties.

There is also the Tate Liverpool in the north of England located in an old warehouse, and the Tate St. Ives in the west country located in an old gas works.

OK_PI,"OKAPI.    	The okapi is closely related to the giraffe, although it does have markings on its legs and haunches that resemble those of a zebra. The okapi's tongue is long enough to reach back and wash its eyeballs, and can even go back further and clean its ears inside and out."
