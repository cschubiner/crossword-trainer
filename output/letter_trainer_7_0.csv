I've never liked Woody Allen films, to be honest, mainly because I'm not a fan of Woody Allen as an actor.

The modern GPS system that we use today was built by the US military who received the massive funding needed because of fears during the Cold War of the use of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. We civilians, all round the world, owe a lot to President Ronald Reagan because he directed the military to make GPS technology available to the public for the common good.

Both ""Hans"" and ""Jean"" translate into English as ""John"". In WWI Arp moved to Switzerland to avoid being called up to fight, taking advantage of Swiss neutrality. Eventually he was told to report to the German Consulate and fill out paperwork for the draft.

Our use of AM and PM dates back to Roman times, with AM standing for Ante Meridiem (before noon) and PM standing for Post Meridiem (after noon). Today we use the concept of AM and PM differently than it was intended. In Ancient Rome, 2 AM say, was 2 hours Ante Meridiem, two hours before noon, which makes sense grammatically anyway.
