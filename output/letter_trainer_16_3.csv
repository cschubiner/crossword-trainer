The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that the mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."

P_PE,POPE.    	Alexander Pope wrote the following lines in 'An Essay on Man' in 1734:
N_E,"NNE.    	Providence is the capital of the state of Rhode Island. The city was founded way back in 1636 by a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony called Roger Williams.

_SN,"USN.    	SEAL is an acronym used by the US Navy's SEa, Air and Land teams. The SEALs were born out of the Navy's special warfare groups from WWII, like the Underwater Demolition Teams and the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons.

CLE_,"CLEO.    	The 1963 movie ""Cleopatra"" really was an epic work. It was the highest grossing film of the year, taking in $26 million dollars at the box office, yet it still lost money. The original budget for the film was just $2 million, but so many things went wrong the final cost swelled to a staggering $44 million dollars, making it the second most expensive movie ever made (taking into account inflation). Elizabeth Taylor was supposed to earn a record amount of $1 million for the film, and ended up earned seven times that amount due to delays. But she paid dearly, as she became seriously ill during shooting and had to have an emergency tracheotomy to save her life. The scar in her throat can actually be seen in some of the shots in the film."
TE_ON,"TETON.    	Grand Teton National Park is located just south of Yellowstone NP, and a must see if you are visiting the latter. The park is named after the tallest peak in the magnificent Teton Range known as Grand Teton.

E_ILE,"EMILE.    	The most famous work of French writer Émile Zola is his 1898 open letter ""J'Accuse!"" written to then French president Félix Faure. The letter was published on the front page of a leading Paris newspaper, and accused the government of anti-Semitism in its handling of the trial of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Dreyfus was a Jewish military officer in the French army, falsely accused and convicted of spying for Germany. Even after the error was discovered, the government refused to back down and let Dreyfus rot away on Devil's Island rather than admit to the mistake. It wasn't until 1906, 12 years after the wrongful conviction, that Dreyfus was freed and reinstated, largely due to the advocacy of Emile Zola."
_JS,"PJS.    	Our word ""pajamas"" ('PJs' for short) comes to us from the Indian subcontinent, where ""pai jamahs"" were loose fitting pants tied at the waist and worn at night by locals and ultimately by the Europeans living there.

CR_,"CRU.    	""Cru"" is a term used in the French wine industry that means ""growth place"". So, ""cru"" is the name of the location where the grapes are grown, as opposed to the name of a specific vineyard. The terms ""premier cru"" and ""grand cru"" are also used, but the usage depends on the specific wine region. Generally it is a classification awarded to specific vineyards denoting their potential for producing great wines. 'Grand cru' is reserved for the very best vineyards, with 'premier cru' the level just below."

DAM_,"DAME.    	I watched the 2006 movie ""The Queen"" again not too long ago. What a great film it is, and what a superb performance from Helen Mirren in the title role of Queen Elizabeth II. It must have been a difficult film for Queen Elizabeth to watch, as it rehashes the PR disaster that surrounded her following the death of Princess Diana. But, she was gracious enough to invite Helen Mirren around to the Palace for dinner after the film was released. Mirren declined however, citing filming commitments in the US. Mirren was invested as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire back in 2003, an honor presented to her by Prince Charles. I wonder will she get another title?"

_ANTA,"SANTA.    	Our image of Santa Claus today, is of a plump and jolly bearded man in a red suit. Prior to the 19th century, the image was more of St. Nicholas, a tall, thin man dressed in Bishop's robes. We owe our version to the German-born American caricaturist Thomas Nash. He drew what we would now call a classic version of Santa Claus for an 1863 edition of ""Harper's Weekly"". That ""friendly"" image has been with us ever since."
C_PRA,"CAPRA.    	I can't tell you how many of Frank Capra's movies are on my list of all-time favorites. He directed such classics as 'It Happened One Night', 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', 'Lost Horizon', 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', 'Meet John Doe', 'Arsenic and Old Lace' and the holiday favorite 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Capra also did his bit during WWII, enlisting just a few days after Pearl Harbor was attacked. Given his great talent, and the fact that he enlisted at the age of 44, the US Army had him direct 11 documentary war films in the 'Why We Fight' series, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal."
APE_,"APES.    	The Bonobo used to be called the Pygmy Chimpanzee, and is a cousin of the Common Chimpanzee.

This is called the Theme Building and I believe it is mainly used as a restaurant and observation deck for the public.

Prints that have been sepia-toned can last in excess of 150 years."

In 1954 she played Tarzan's love interest in ""Tarzan's Hidden Jungle"" (and ended up marrying ""Tarzan"", actor Gordon Scott).

She did get a role in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" though, playing Lila Crane, the woman who discovered the secrets of Norman Bates and his motel."
_OTH,"ROTH.    	The 1974 crime drama 'The Godfather Part II' is a little unusual in that it qualifies as both a prequel and a sequel to the 1972 film 'The Godfather'. It is a prequel in that it tells the story of Vito Corleone's journey from Sicily to New York and the founding of his Mafia family. It is a sequel in that it tells the story of Michael Corleone taking over and running the crime family established by his father. Vito Corleone is famously played by Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather', and by Robert De Niro in 'The Godfather Part II'. Michael Corleone is played by Al Pacino in both films."

APE_,"APES.    	""Tarzan"" is the title character in the series of books created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The line ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" never appeared in the books, and indeed doesn't even figure in the movies. Apparently Johnny Weissmuller (who played Tarzan in the thirties and forties) saw Maureen O'Sullivan (""Jane"", to Weissmuller's ""Tarzan"") struggling with a suitcase in the parking lot during filming.

This is called the Theme Building and I believe it is mainly used as a restaurant and observation deck for the public.

So, ""suede"" is simply the French word for Sweden."

ASWA_,"ASWAN.    	The city of Aswan is one of the driest places on earth, so dry in fact that many locals do not bother putting roofs on all the rooms in their dwellings.

The Low Dam was first built in 1902 (and modified later). The High Dam was completed in 1970."

You may recall that every time Frau Blücher's name was mentioned, any horse within earshot would be terrified. Leachman auditioned for a reprise of the Blücher role in the stage production of ""Young Frankenstein"" in 2007. She didn't get the part, as Mel Brooks thought she was just too old to play it.

SW_N,"SWAN.    	Hans Christian Andersen's tale ""The Ugly Duckling"" has to be one of the most endearing ever written. Unlike so many ""fairy tales"", ""The Ugly Duckling"" isn't based on any folklore and simply a product of Andersen's imagination. It is speculated that Andersen was the illegitimate son of the Crown Prince of Denmark, and that he wrote the story of the ugly duckling that turned into a beautiful swan as a metaphor for the secret royal lineage that was within Andersen himself."
N_Z,"NEZ.    	The Nez Percé tribe of the Pacific Northwest call themselves the Nimiipuu, meaning ""The Real People"". The name Nez Percé means ""pierced nose"" in French, a name applied in error to the Nimiipuu instead of the neighboring Chinook tribe, that did in fact practice nose piercing."

He was a favorite author as I was growing up and I must admit that some hero worship on my part led me to study and work as a biochemist for a short while early in my career.

Restoration work in the inner city in recent decades led to it being designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, however, in 2006 when the city built a highway bridge close to the city center, UNESCO took Dresden off the list.

MOOR_,"MOORE.    	Like all of his films, Michael Moore's 2007 documentary ""Sicko"" tends to polarize the audience. The film deals with the health care system in the United States, comparing it with the systems in place in other countries. Having lived in two of the countries covered in the movie, France and the UK, I can attest that the basic facts presented about those foreign health care systems are accurate. Now Moore's style of presentation of those facts ... that might give rise to some debate ..."

S_ENOS,"STENOS.    	Stenography is the process of writing in shorthand. The term comes from the Greek ""steno"" (narrow) and ""graphe"" (writing)."
_RANGE,"ORANGE.    	I got this one pretty quickly ... One interpretation of the colors of the tricolor are that the green represent the Irish Nationalist movement striving for independence from Britain, and the Orange movement concentrated in the north of the country (now Northern Ireland) that favors British rule. The white is a hopeful representation of peace between the two ideals. The flag's design dates back to 1848 when it was presented to Irish Nationalist Thomas Francis Meagher by a small group of sympathetic French women. It was likely inspired by the French tricolor, although it might also have derived from the Newfoundland Tricolour, as Meagher's father was born there."

ORIO_E,"ORIOLE.    	The Baltimore Orioles was one of the eight charter teams of MLB's American League, so the franchise dates back to 1901. Prior to 1901, the team has roots in the Minor League Milwaukee Brewers, and indeed entered the American League as the Brewers. In 1902 the Brewers moved to St. Louis and became the Browns. The team didn't fare well in St. Louis, so when it finally relocated to Baltimore in the early fifties the team changed its name completely, to the Baltimore Orioles. The owners so badly wanted a fresh start that they traded 17 old Browns players with the New York Yankees. The trade didn't help the team's performance on the field in those early days, but it did help distance the new team from its past."
A_S,"AUS.    	The name 'Austria' is a Latin variant of the German name for the country, 'Österreich'. 'Österreich' itself means 'Eastern borderlands', a reference to the country's history as a prefecture of neighboring Bavaria to the west."

L_S,"LBS.    	The unit of mass that we know today as a 'pound' is descended from the old Roman unit of weight known as a 'libra'. That 'libra' connection is why we abbreviate 'pound' to 'lb'.

A_WAN,"ASWAN.    	The city of Aswan is one of the driest places on earth, so dry in fact that many locals do not bother putting roofs on all the rooms in their dwellings. The last time it rained in Aswan (apparently the latest info, as early April 2010) was a thunderstorm on May 13, 2006. The nearby Aswan Dam is very famous, and is actually two dams.

O_OES,"OBOES.    	The oboe is perhaps my favorite of the reed instruments. The name ""oboe"" comes from the French ""hautbois"" which means ""high wood"". When you hear an orchestra tuning before a performance, you'll note (pun intended!) the oboe starts off the process by playing an ""A"". The rest of the musicians in turn tune to that oboe's ""A"". Oh, and if you want to read a fun book (almost an ""exposé"") about life playing the oboe, you might try ""Mozart in the Jungle"" by oboist Blair Tindall.
