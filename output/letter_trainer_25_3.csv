B_HS,"BAHS.    	The classic 1843 novella ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens has left us with a few famous phrases and words.

And thirdly, everyone knows that the character Scrooge uttered the famous line ""Bah! Humbug!""."

SLEET_,"SLEETS.    	Apparently ""sleet"" is a term used to describe two weather conditions. One is a shower of ice pellets, smaller than hail, and the second is a mixture of rain and snow, with the snow melting as it falls. It's the second definition that I have always used ..."

LIAN_,LIANA.    	Liana is the name give to vines that generally grow in moist areas such as rain forests. They grow using the trees in the forest as structural support. My bet is that Tarzan swung from tree to tree on liana vines ...

The bloody conflict that has existed between the Tutsi and Hutu peoples dates back to about 1880 when Catholic missionaries arrived in the region. The missionaries found that they had more success converting the Hutus than the Tutsi, and when the Germans occupied the area during WWI they confiscated Tutsi land and gave it to Hutu tribes in order to reward religious conversion. This injustice fuels fighting to this very day."
GYR_S,"GYROS.    	A gyro is a traditional Greek dish, a sandwich made with pita bread containing meat, tomato, onion and tzatziki (a yogurt and cucumber sauce).

'CSI: Miami' (the 'worst' of the franchise, I think) was cancelled in 2012 after ten seasons. 'CSI: NY' (the 'best' of the franchise) was cancelled in 2013 after nine seasons.

The youngest show in the series is 'CSI: Cyber', and it's still on the air."
H_C,"HOC.    	The term 'post hoc' is used to describe a conclusion made about an earlier event at the time of a later event. Post hoc reasoning is basically an argument late in the day that the earlier event caused the later event, if you know what I mean!"

HOW_,"HOWE.    	In 1856 William Steffe wrote the tune that was eventually used for ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"".

After the outbreak of the Civil War, Thomas Bishop composed lyrics to a famous abolitionist version of the tune, ""John Brown's Body"".

_FROS,"AFROS.    	The full name of the famed stage show from the sixties is ""Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical"". This controversial work outraged many when it was first performed in the sixties as it attacked many aspects of life at the time. For example, the song ""Air"" is a satirical look at pollution, sung by a character who comes onto the stage wearing a gas mask. The opening lines are ""Welcome, sulfur dioxide. Hello carbon monoxide. The air ... is everywhere"". I've never had the chance to see 'Hair' in a live production, but it's on 'the bucket list' ..."
AM_LIA,"AMELIA.    	""Amelia"" was the fourth and last novel written by Henry Fielding, first published in 1751. The book is considered somewhat sentimental, and it is thought that the title character is based on Fielding's first wife, Charlotte, who passed away not long before he started writing ""Amelia"". The novel is noted partly for its position on ""female intelligence"", underscoring the need to create opportunities for the education of women, an unusual position for a man at that time."
YAS_R,"YASIR.    	The Oslo Accords grew out of secret negotiations between high level PLO and Israeli delegates in a residence in Oslo.

_AGE,RAGE.    	It's all the rage ...
NOR_,"NORM.    	The character of Norm Peterson was the only customer of the bar to appear in every episode of ""Cheers"", something that one couldn't call ironic since he loved that barstool! George Wendt played Norm, and I suppose the fact the Wendt was expelled from Notre Dame after one semester, with a 0.0 GPA, that might have helped him get the role!"
A_D,"ADD.    	To ""foot up"" is to add a column of numbers."
C_AT,"COAT.    	If you've watched Victorian dramas you might have seen the original Ulster coat, which is very distinctive.

A_RS,"AIRS.    	Believe it or not, the word ""hoity-toity"" has been in the English language since the 1660s, but back then it meant ""riotous behavior"". It began to be used to mean ""haughty"" in the late 1800s, simply because the two terms sounded familiar."
SANK_,"SANKA.    	The first successful process for removing caffeine from coffee involved steaming the beans in salt water, and then extracting the caffeine using benzene (a potent carcinogen) as a solvent. Coffee processed this way was sold as Sanka here in the US. There are other processes used these days, and let's hope they are safer ..."

_ION,"SION.    	The Priory of Sion is presented in the preface of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", as a secret society that did in fact exist. However, there is a lot of evidence that the priory was an invention, created in forged documents in the sixties. Regardless, Dan Brown's book is a really enjoyable read."

AL_AST,"AL EAST.    	The Tampa Bay Rays is a relatively ""young"" franchise, being formed in 1998.

The name was changed to the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008, and I am told the Rays started into a streak of winning seasons soon after."
_LOP,"ALOP.    	I had to go to one of my two huge volumes of the OED to find the definition of ""alop"". It means ""lop-sided"". A lovely word, I think, but amazing that it seems to have avoided the Internet!"
B_ASE,"BLASE.    	'Blasé', meaning 'nonchalant, bored from overindulgence' comes from the French verb 'blaser', meaning ""to satiate""."
BE_T,"BERT.    	I've always believed that the ""Sesame Street"" characters Bert and Ernie were named after two roles played in the Christmas classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". In the movie, the policeman's name is Bert, and his taxi driving buddy is named Ernie. However, the ""Sesame Street"" folks have stated that the use of the same names is just a coincidence."
_VE,I'VE.    	Elvis Presley recorded the song 'I've Lost You' in 1970.
A_IT,"ADIT.    	An adit is specific type of mine access, a horizontal shaft that extends into the mine.

ADREN_L,"ADRENAL.    	Norepinephrine is a hormone produced in an adrenal gland, sometimes called simply 'an adrenal'."

N_OH,"NAOH.    	Caustic soda is sometimes called lye. Chemically it is sodium hydroxide (NaOH). It's nasty stuff, a white solid in its pure form. When you add it to water it generates an awful lot of heat, a property that is taken advantage of in using lye as a drain cleaner."

Some of you will no doubt remember her playing Cat Woman on the final series of the TV show ""Batman""."
N_VAL,"NAVAL.    	The official residence of the VP of the United States is at Number One Observatory Circle, in the grounds of the Naval Observatory. The house was built in 1893 for the use of the superintendent of the observatory. In 1974 it was taken over by Act of Congress for use as the VP's official residence. The move was partly a matter of economics as the cost of providing security for the Vice President at his own residence was becoming prohibitive. Reportedly, there was an underground bunker build below the house after the 9/11 attacks."
ME_LE,"MERLE.    	Merle Oberon was a wonderful British actress. At the height of her Hollywood career she was involved in a traffic accident that left her with permanent facial scars. The marks were so disfiguring that it was believed that Oberon would never appear on screen again.

ULE_S,"ULEE'S.    	""Ulee's Gold"" is a highly respected film from 1997, in which Peter Fonda plays the title role of Ulee. Ulee's ""gold"" is the honey that Ulee produced.

So if you see Peter Fonda in ""Ulee's Gold"", you're witnessing some characteristics that Peter saw in his father."

Mods came into conflict with another subculture that emerged at the same time in the UK, the rockers. Rockers were into rock and roll music, and drove motor cycles.

HAY_N,"HAYDN.    	'The Creation' is an oratorio by the great composer Joseph Haydn, written between 1796 and 1798. Many consider it to be his magnum opus.

It tells of Hansel and Gretel, the children of a woodcutter, who are abandoned in a forest at the behest of an evil stepmother. Clever Hansel hears of the plan, and leaves a trail of pebbles so that he and his sister find their way home. But the children are abandoned again, and this time leave a trail of breadcrumbs.

TI_ANE,"TIRANE.    	Tirane is the capital city of Albania and has been so since 1920. The city was seized by the Nazis in WWII but was liberated in 1944, at which point the Communists seized power. The Communists were ousted in the elections of 1992 leaving a void that led to much bloodshedd and an eventual EU military mission, led by Italy, to stabilize the capital and the rest of the country. Today things have become so calm that Albania is a member of NATO."

STRA_I,"STRATI.    	Stratus clouds (plural 'strati') are very common, and as they are wider than they are tall and flat along the bottom, we might just see them as haze in a featureless sky above us. Stratus clouds are basically the same as fog, but above the ground. Indeed, many stratus clouds are formed when morning fog lifts into the air as the ground heats up."
YE_,"YER.    	The beguiling Norah Jones is one of my favorite singers. She is the daughter of sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar. If you haven't heard her ""Come Away with Me"", you haven't lived ..."

H_AT,"HEAT.    	The heat index combines air temperature and relative humidity, an attempt to measure the relative temperature that is actually perceived by a person.

N_O,"NGO.    	When France withdrew from French Indochina in the mid-fifties, Ngo Dinh Diem led the movement to create the Republic of Vietnam.

RAI_ER,"RAIDER.    	The business strategy known as ""corporate raiding"" really is pretty ruthless and short sighted (excuse my being judgmental). The idea is to buy a large interest in a corporation, sometimes ""stealthily"", by buying up a significant number of voting shares. Then the raider uses the power of the voting rights to convince other voters to change the way the company is run, purely to increase the share price in the relatively short term. The changes often involve replacement of the management team, downsizing and even liquidation of the company, all for short term personal gain."
TUR_O,"TURBO.    	A turbocharger is a device that is designed to extract more power out of an internal combustion engine. It does so by increasing the pressure of the air entering the intake.

CRIM_A,"CRIMEA.    	Considering that the Crimea was the site of the Charge of the Light Brigade as well as the Yalta conference towards the end of World War II, I am ashamed to say that until recently I could not pinpoint the Crimea on a map. I'm even more ashamed to say that I didn't realize it is an extremely distinctively shaped peninsula, lying south of the Ukraine and jutting out into the Black Sea. Well, now I know ..."
_LEES,"ULEE'S.    	""Ulee's Gold"" is a highly respected film from 1997 in which Peter Fonda plays the title role of Ulee. Ulee's ""gold"" is the honey that Ulee produces. It is a favorite role for Peter Fonda and he has shared that playing Ulee brought into mind his father, Henry Fonda, who himself kept a couple of hives. So if you see Peter Fonda in ""Ulee's Gold"" you're witnessing some characteristics that Peter saw in his father."
SABI_,"SABIN.    	Albert Sabin developed the oral polio vaccine. Sabin's vaccine was a ""live"", controlled vaccine. The equally famous Salk vaccine was a ""killed"" vaccine."
SO_,"SOX.    	The Boston Red Sox is one of the most successful Major League Baseball teams and so commands a large attendance, but only when on the road. The relatively small capacity of Boston's Fenway Park, the team's home since 1912, has dictated that every game the Red Sox has played there has been a sell out since May of 2003."
S_LO,"ST-LO.    	Saint-Lo is a town in Normandy that was occupied by Germany in 1940. Saint-Lo stood at a strategic crossroads, and so there was intense fighting there during the Normandy invasion of 1944. After the bombardment, very little of the town was left standing."

LO_RE,"LORRE.    	The marvelous actor Peter Lorre was born in what is now modern-day Slovakia. His real name was Laszlo Lowenstein. He started acting in Vienna, when he was quite young, only 17 years old. When Hitler came to power, the Jewish Lowenstein headed to Paris, then London, eventually ending up in Hollywood. He found himself typecast as the wicked foreigner in American movies, but I think he sneered and snarled his way to the bank."
_ASTLA,"EAST LA.    	'Stand and Deliver' is a 1988 drama film based on the true story of Jaime Escalante, a high school teacher in East LA."

MTSINA_,"MT SINAI.    	According to the Bible, Mount Sinai is the mountain on which Moses was given the Ten Commandments. The Biblical Mount Sinai is probably not the mountain in Egypt that today has the same name, although this is the subject of much debate. The Egyptian Mount Sinai has two developed routes that one can take to reach the summit. The longer gentler climb takes about 2 1/2 hours, but there is also the steeper climb up the 3,750 ""steps of penitence""."
ALO_,"ALOP.    	I had to go to one of my two huge volumes of the OED to find the definition of ""alop"". It means ""lop-sided"". A lovely word, I think, but it's amazing that it seems to have avoided the Internet!"

His most famous work in the pointillist style can be viewed in the Art Institute of Chicago, ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte - 1884"".

MAEW_ST,"MAE WEST.    	Mae West was always pushing the envelope when it came to the ""sexy"" side of show business, even in her early days in Vaudeville. While still quite young, she moved into legitimate theater, eventually writing her own risque plays. One of her own Broadway plays in which she starred was called ""Sex"". The show was a sell out, but city officials had it raided and West found herself spending ten days in jail after being convicted of ""corrupting the morals of youth"". She went into the movies in 1932, already 38 years old. West used her experience writing plays to rewrite much of the material she was given, and so really was totally responsible for her own success and on-screen appeal."
_OS,KOS.    	You might 'see stars' when you get knocked out.
LIAN_,"LIANA.    	Liane is better known as liana, and is the name give to vines that generally grow in moist areas such as rain forests. They grow using the trees in teh forest as support. My bet is that Tarzan swung from tree to tree on liana vines."

Lastly there is an even younger brother, Rerun van Pelt. Rerun is constantly hiding under his bed, trying to avoid going to school."
S_REP,"STREP.    	Streptococcus bacteria multiply and divide along a single axis so that they form linked chains. That behavior gives the genus of bacteria its name, as 'streptos' is Greek for 'easily twisted, like a chain'.

Another species of streptococcus is responsible for that terrible 'flesh-eating' infection that makes the news from time to time."

HBO_B,"H-BOMB.    	There are two classes of nuclear weapons, both of which get the energy for the explosion from nuclear reactions.
