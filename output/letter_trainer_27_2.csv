The prize included a four-year residence at the French Academy in Rome. But, Debussy was far from inspired by his stay in Rome, had no liking for Italian opera, and lacked the inspiration to compose.

And that's how the soap opera got its nickname."

Two spies, Caleb and Joshuah, came back with valid reports, that the Hebrews could inhabit Canaan. As a result of the false reports from the ten spies, the Hebrews did not enter Canaan but instead wandered the desert for another forty years, before they finally took up residence in the promised land.

""Britannica"" declined, fearing that an online version would damage their print sales. ""Britannica"" had to sell eventually, but not to Microsoft, as the inevitable decline in print sales happened anyway.

_UL,"CUL.    	Even though ""cul-de-sac"" can indeed mean ""bottom of the bag"" in French, the term cul-de-sac is of English origin (the use of ""cul"" in French is actually quite rude).

It is now the longest running musical in the history of London's West End, and is playing at the Queen's Theater. I saw Les Miz in the Queen's Theater, only able to get tickets in the very back row. The theater seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is very high over the stage. One of the big events in the show is the building of a street barricade, and the fighting over it. At that height we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even having a cigarette. On cue they would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy it that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the story didn't grab me as it is portrayed in the musical."
S_SS,"SESS.    	The US Congress is described 'bicameral' in that it is divided into two separate assemblies, namely the Senate and the House of Representatives. The term 'bicameral' comes from the prefix 'bi-' meaning 'two', and the Latin 'camera' meaning 'chamber'."

Years later, the Stroh Brewing Company introduced a European process called fire-brewing.

By the way, even though the American Stroh's brewery was set up in 1850, the label bears the words 'since 1775'. This is a reference to the date that the Stroh family started brewing back in Germany."

_HREE,"THREE.    	There is a suggestions that the use of the term 'turkey' to describes three strikes in a row in bowling arose in the late 1700s.
