As he acquired fame on the baseball field, he was given the nickname ""Casey"", largely because he came from Kansas City (""KC"") and also because of the popularity of the poem ""Casey at the Bat"".

The prize included a four-year residence at the French Academy in Rome. But, Debussy was far from inspired by his stay in Rome, had no liking for Italian opera, and lacked the inspiration to compose.

Aeolus was the ruler of the winds in Greek mythology, and he gave his name to the adjective ""aeolian"" (also 'aeolic, eolic') meaning ""windblown"", something produced or carried by the wind.

SAGA_,"SAGAS.    	As almost everyone knows, the original ""soap operas"" were radio dramas back in the fifties. Given the structure of society back then, the daytime broadcasts were aimed at housewives working in the home.

And that's how the soap opera got its nickname."

It is the longest running musical in the history of Broadway, and deservedly so. And now there is a sequel, which I would dearly love to see, so let's hope it gets over here soon. ""Love Never Dies"" opened in the West End in London in March 2010, but the opening in the US has been delayed while Lloyd Weber recovers from surgery for prostate cancer."

Two spies, Caleb and Joshuah, came back with valid reports, that the Hebrews could inhabit Canaan. As a result of the false reports from the ten spies, the Hebrews did not enter Canaan but instead wandered the desert for another forty years, before they finally took up residence in the promised land.

""Britannica"" declined, fearing that an online version would damage their print sales. ""Britannica"" had to sell eventually, but not to Microsoft, as the inevitable decline in print sales happened anyway.

LESM_Z,"LES MIZ.    	The 1980 musical ""Les Miserables"" is an adaptation of the 1862 novel of the same name by Victor Hugo. It is now the longest running musical in the history of London's West End, and is playing at the Queen's Theater. I saw Les Miz in the Queen's Theater, only able to get tickets in the very back row. The theater seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is very high over the stage. One of the big events in the show is the building of a street barricade, and the fighting over it. At that height we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even having a cigarette. On cue they would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy it that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the story didn't grab me as it is portrayed in the musical."
S_SS,"SESS.    	The US Congress is described 'bicameral' in that it is divided into two separate assemblies, namely the Senate and the House of Representatives. The term 'bicameral' comes from the prefix 'bi-' meaning 'two', and the Latin 'camera' meaning 'chamber'."

By the way, even though the American Stroh's brewery was set up in 1850, the label bears the words 'since 1775'. This is a reference to the date that the Stroh family started brewing back in Germany."

_HREE,"THREE.    	There is a suggestions that the use of the term 'turkey' to describes three strikes in a row in bowling arose in the late 1700s.
