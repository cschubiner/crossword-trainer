When he was touring with his two backing singers Pattie Swallie and Elizabeth Gevara, all three of them shared a room together.

The arrangement was quite open, it seems, with all ten kids visiting each other regularly. To each his own ..."

The word 'tebah' is also used in the Bible for the basket in which Moses was placed by his mother when she floated him down the Nile. It seems that the word 'tebah' doesn't mean 'boat' and nor does it mean 'basket'. Rather, a more appropriate translation is 'life-preserver' or 'life-saver'. So, Noah's ark was Noah's life-preserver during the flood."

The second visit was in September 1960 without an invitation, when he appointed himself temporary head of the USSR delegation to the United Nations. The US responded to his unannounced visit by limiting his travel to the island of Manhattan and visits to a Soviet-owned estate on Long Island. During one of the debates at the UN, Khrushchev became outraged at a statement made by the Filipino delegate who called the Soviets two-faced for decrying colonialism while forcibly dominating and occupying Eastern Europe. Khrushchev demanded the right to reply immediately, and when the Filipino delegate refused to yield, the Soviet leader famously took off his shoe and began to pound it on his desk."

Well, I think that most readers come to like the young lady by the end of the tale ..."

The event gets a lot of coverage, so boosts the local economy as journalists hit the town. It is a very successful fundraiser for the Republican Party in Iowa as well, but the usefulness of the straw poll in predicting the eventual winner of the nomination is less clear.

Winehouse's lifestyle caught up with her in 2011 when she was found dead from alcohol poisoning.

A_DA,"ALDA.    	""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is a 1989 black comedy written and directed by Woody Allen. I'm afraid I not a fan of Woody Allen's work, so I have never seen the movie. Alan Alda plays a pompous brother-in-law of the main character, who of course is played by Woody Allen himself."

I must say, it can be a beautiful item of clothing."

Regular readers will know that I am unashamedly supportive of my native Irish culture, but I have to tell you that I can't handle the works of James Joyce, although I have spent many a fine day traipsing around Ireland learning about his life. To me, his life is more absorbing than his writing. Having said that, ""Ulysses"" is an interesting novel in that it chronicles just one, ordinary day in the life of a Dubliner, Leopold Bloom. There's a huge celebration of ""Ulysses"" in Dublin every year on June 16th, called Bloomsday. The festivities vary from readings and performances of the storyline, to good old pub crawls."

Then in 2002, PayPal was bought by eBay for a whopping $1.5 billion."
OB_MA,"OBAMA.    	I have never tweeted in my life, and have no plans to do so. Twitter is a microblogging service that limits any post sent to just 140 characters. In a sense, it is similar to this blog. Here I send out a post once a day containing information that I think might be useful to folks (thank you for reading!). I don't think I could send out much of interest using just 140 characters."
ARA_,"ARAB.    	""The Stranger"" was Albert Camus's first novel, and it is probably his most famous. The original title in French is 'L'Étranger', which can indeed be translated as 'The Stranger'.

Cervantes wrote his story just after the year 1600, so the game has been around at least since then. Twenty-one came to the US but it wasn't all that popular so bonus payments were introduced to create more interest. One of the more attractive bonuses was a ten-to-one payout to a player who was dealt an ace of spades and a black jack. This bonus led to the game adopting the moniker ""Blackjack""."

RE_,"RED.    	If you're sitting behind a car that doesn't make a right on red, it may just be a rental car driven by someone from Europe. Speaking as someone who learned to drive over there, I must admit I held up a few people at red lights when I first visited this country. That's because in Europe we aren't allowed to make any move past a red light, unless there is an accompanying green arrow. So, if you're driving over there, take care ..."
E_MA,"EMMA.    	I am going to have to check out this film now that I've learned it is based on ""Emma"", a favorite of mine. However, 1995's ""Clueless"" is set in a Beverly Hills high school, so I had best prepare myself for disappointment ..."

ET_,ETD.    	Estimated time of departure (ETD)
EA_,"EAR.    	I so much preferred 'The Bionic Woman' over the original show, 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. That was probably because I was 'at that age' in the mid-seventies, when the star Lindsay Wagner was attracting my attention! Wagner played Jaime Sommers who was badly injured in a parachute jump, and she was given robotic implants that gave her speed, strength and exceptional hearing."
ED_,EDU.    	Internet addresses (like NYTCrossword.com and LAXCrossword.com) are more correctly called Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).

_NEAL,"O'NEAL.    	There's no doubt that the 1970 movie 'Love Story' is one of the great romantic dramas of all time, but I just think Ali MacGraw was hopelessly miscast and really took the shine off the film for me.

ALO_A,"ALOHA.    	The 2015 romantic comedy 'Aloha' has a great cast, which includes Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams, Bill Murray and John Krasinski. Regardless, the film seems to have been poorly received. Maybe one day I'll give it an airing, just out of respect for the actors ..."

AV_,"AVA.    	Ava Gardner is noted for her association with some big movies, but also for her association with some big names when it came to the men in her life.

The men in her life included husbands Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra. After her marriages had failed (and perhaps before!) she had long-term relationships with Howard Hughes and bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguin whom she met through her friend Ernest Hemingway."
T_E,"TSE.    	Andrew Lloyd Webber's source material for his hit musical ""Cats"" was T. S. Eliot's ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"". Eliot's collection of whimsical poems was published in 1939, and was a personal favorite of Webber as he was growing up. ""Cats"" is the second longest running show in Broadway history (""Phantom of the Opera"" is the longest and is still running; deservedly so in my humble opinion). my wife and I have seen 'Cats' a couple of times and really enjoyed it ..."

The song was recorded in 1968, with the band formally dissolving in 1970.

AME_,"AMES.    	Aldrich Ames worked for the CIA until he was convicted in 1994 of spying for the Soviet Union. Prior to identifying Ames as a spy, the CIA was highly concerned at the high rate of disappearance of their own agents behind the Iron Curtain and they struggled for years to find the mole that they assumed must be working within their own ranks. After he was finally arrested, the CIA was criticized for not having identified Ames sooner, particularly as he was living an extravagant lifestyle relative to his apparent means. He is serving a life sentence in the US Penitentiary in Allentown, Pennsylvania."
_DEN,"ADEN.    	The Gulf of Aden is the body of water that lies south of the Red Sea, and just north of the Horn of Africa."
RE_,RED.    	Red Hots are cinnamon-flavored candy pieces. I just found out that Red Hots are sometimes used in apple sauce ...
_RIO,"TRIO.    	When the TV show 'Charlie's Angels' started airing in the mid-seventies it was a little unusual in that it featured three women playing private detectives, a role usually reserved for men.

The Blackhawks were one of the 17 original teams playing at the founding of the National Basketball Association.

AD_M,"ADAM.

_IA,"NIA.    	Not only was the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" she also wrote the screenplay. The movie never made it to number one at the box office, but still pulled in more money than any other in the category of ""movies that didn't make it to number one"". That record I think reflects that the film wasn't a blockbuster, but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came after the movie, when a spin-off TV show was launched, ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It only ran for 7 episodes."
I_AC,"IMAC.    	The iMac is a desktop computer platform from Apple introduced in 1998. One of the main features of the iMac is an ""all-in-one"" design, with the computer console and monitor integrated."

R_D,"RED.    	The number of colors in the visible spectrum is actually infinite because the spectrum is a continuum. However, the human eye can distinguish about 100 different colors in all. The brain tends to divide the rainbow of colors into a smaller number, seven so-called primary colors:"

ST_,"STU.    	Stu Sutcliffe was one of the original four members of The Silver Beatles (as The Beatles were known in their early days), along with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison. Sutcliffe apparently came up with name ""Beatles"" along with John Lennon, as a homage to their hero Buddy Holly who was backed by the ""Crickets"". By all reports, Sutcliffe wasn't a very talented musician and was more interested in painting. He went with the group to Hamburg, more than once, but he eventually left the Beatles and went back to art school, actually studying for a while at the Hamburg College of Art. In 1962 in Hamburg, Sutcliffe collapsed with blinding headaches. He died in the ambulance on the way to hospital, his death attributed to cerebral paralysis."

The men in her life included husbands Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra. After her marriages had failed (and perhaps before!) she had long term relationships with Howard Hughes and bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguin whom she met through her friend Ernest Hemingway."
_RNIE,"ERNIE.    	For many years, I believed that the ""Sesame Street"" characters Bert and Ernie were named after two roles played in the Christmas classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". In the movie, the policeman's name is Bert and his taxi-driving buddy is named Ernie. However, the ""Sesame Street"" folks have stated that the use of the same names is just a coincidence."

A_TA,"ASTA.    	Asta was the wonderful little dog in the superb movie ""The Thin Man"" starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. In the original story by Dashiell Hammett, Asta was a female Schnauzer, but on screen Asta was played by a wire-haired fox terrier called ""Skippy"". Skippy was also the dog in ""Bringing up Baby"" with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, the one who kept stealing the dinosaur bone.

_TL,"ATL.    	The Falkland Islands are in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 300 miles off the coast of Argentina. The Falklands have been claimed as an overseas territory by various European nations, with the British having the most persistent claim from the northern hemisphere. Understandably perhaps, nearby Argentina has claimed ownership of the islands for centuries. The dispute between Britain and Argentina came to a head in 1982 when Argentine forces invaded the Falklands. It took weeks for a British expeditionary force to arrive in the area, but they emerged victorious after some explosive air and naval battles that resulted in the death of 255 British and 649 Argentine military personnel."
S_RI,"SARI.    	A sari (also saree) is a strip of cloth, as one might imagine, but is usually unstitched along its length. In length it can range from four to nine meters (that's a lot of material!). The sari is usually wrapped around the waist, then draped over the shoulder leaving the midriff bare. I must say, it can be a beautiful item of clothing."
E_U,"EDU.    	A domain name is basically the address of a website on the Internet. Not too long ago I moved the website for this blog to a new address (from puzzle.paxient.com to NYTCrossword.com). Like in the real world, one pays for an address. I now own (well rent!) both of the addresses used for this blog, but choose to ""do business"", publish the blog, at the more memorable address ... NYTCrossword.com. It's sort of like preferring to have a Park Avenue address instead of one on say Elm Street. In the Internet world, elements of the domain name are intended to indicate what type of activity goes on at a particular address. So an address with "".com"" implies a ""company"" website, a "".org"" implies a non-profit website and "".edu"" implies an education website. But, in reality anyone can rent whatever address they want, as it just goes to the highest bidder. Most folks remember "".com"" addresses, so they are the most popular. "".com"" is meant to imply a ""business address"" as I say, but it can even be used for somewhere to chat about crosswords!"
AR_B,"ARAB.    	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the largest Arab country in the Middle East and is the world's largest oil producer, home to the world's largest oil reserves. The Saudi dynasty started in central Arabia in 1744 when the secular leader Muhammad ibn Saud joined forces with the Islamic scholar and Imam, Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab. At the time, Saud was a ruler of a town near Riyadh and he was determined to bring ""true"" Islam to the Arabian peninsula. Since 1744 the fortunes of the Saudi family have risen and fallen, but it is that same family who rules what we know today as Saudi Arabia."
E_AT,"ETAT.    	""L'Etat, c'est moi"" is a French phrase, supposedly spoken by Louis XIV on his death bed. It translates to ""I am the State"", an would appear to mean that Louis considered himself to be ""above his station"" as it were.

A_AR,"AGAR.    	John Agar was a Hollywood actor from Chicago, noted for his on-screen appearances alongside John Wayne.

TE_,"TEA.    	The independent nation of Bangladesh was established after the Bnagladesh Liberation War of 1971, when the East Pakistan was secceeded by the State of Pakistan.
