S_AN,"SEAN.    	Actor Sean Penn is a two-time Oscar winner, for his roles in 'Mystic River' released in 2003 and 'Milk' released in 2008. Penn's celebrity on screen is only matched with his fame off the screen. Apart from his 'big name' marriages to singer Madonna and actress Robin Wright, Penn is also well known for political and social activism. He perhaps inherited some of his political views from his father, actor and director Leo Penn. As an actor, Leo refused to 'name names' in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee and so was blacklisted in Hollywood and had to move into directing to put bread on the table. In later years as a director he gave his son Sean his first acting role, in a 1974 episode of 'Little House on the Prairie'."
E_O,ECO.    	Ecocide is the wanton destruction of the natural environment.
I_AO,"ISAO.    	Isao Aoki is one of Japan's greatest golfers, now playing on the senior circuit. Aoki's best finish in a major tournament was runner-up to Jack Nicklaus in the 1980 US Open. Aoki is relatively tall (6 feet), and his height earned him the nickname 'Tower', after the Tokyo Tower."
E_E,"EYE.    	Horus was one of the oldest gods in Ancient Egyptian religion. Most often, Horus was depicted as a falcon or a man with a falcon head. The Eye of Horus was a common symbol used in Ancient Egypt, a symbol of protection and royal power."

YE_S,"YENS.    	The word ""yen"", meaning ""urge"", has been around in English since the very early 1900s. It comes from the earlier word ""yin"" imported from Chinese, which was used in English to describe an intense craving for opium!"
YS_,"YSL.    	Yves Saint-Laurent (YSL) was a French fashion designer, actually born in Algeria. Saint-Laurent started off working as an assistant to Christian Dior at the age of 17. Dior died just four years later, and as a very young man Saint-Laurent was named head of the House of Dior. However, in 1950 Saint-Laurent was conscripted into the French Army and ended up in a military hospital after suffering a mental breakdown from the hazing inflicted on him by his fellow soldiers. His treatment included electroshock therapy and administration of sedatives and psychoactive drugs. He was released from hospital, managed to pull his life back together and started his own fashion house. A remarkable story ..."

E_TD,ESTD.    	Established (estd.)
SS_S,"SSNS.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."
RO_,ROM.    	Read only memory (ROM)
ALIC_,"ALICE.    	In Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"", towards the end of the story Alice finds herself as a witness in a trial in front of the King and Queen of Hearts.

EF_,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants unlike the eggs of frogs and toads which float freely. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."
_AM,"TAM.    	A tam o'shanter is a man's cap traditionally worn by Scotsmen. ""Tams"" were originally all blue (and called ""blue bonnets""), but as more dyes became readily available they became more colorful. The name of the cap comes from the title character of Robert Burns' poem ""Tam O'Shanter""."

DEC_,"DECO.

_LO,"FLO.    	Progressive is a popular auto insurance company, the one that uses the perky character named 'Flo' as a spokeswoman. Flo is played by comedienne and actress Stephanie Courtney."
SO_O,"SOHO.    	The Manhattan neighborhood known today as SoHo was very fashionable in the early 1900s, but as the well-heeled started to move uptown the area became very run down and poorly maintained. Noted for the number of fires that erupted in derelict buildings, SoHo earned the nickname 'Hell's Hundred Acres'. The area was then zoned for manufacturing and became home to many sweatshops. In the mid-1900s artists started to move into open loft spaces and renovating old buildings as the lofts were ideal locations in which an artist could both live and work. In 1968, artists and others organized themselves so that they could legalize their residential use of an area zoned for manufacturing. The group they formed took its name from the name given to the area by the city's Planning Commission i.e 'South of Houston'. This was shortened from So-uth of Ho-uston to SoHo as in the SoHo Artists Association, and the name stuck."
ENIA_,"ENIAC.    	The acronym ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (although many folks insist that the C was for ""Computer""). ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables, but it ended up being used early on to make calculations necessary for the development of the hydrogen bomb. Given its uses, it's not surprising to hear that development of ENIAC was funded by the US Army during WWII."
IP_D,"IPAD.    	The very exciting iPad isn't Apple's first foray into the world of tablet computing by any means. Apple created great buzz by introducing the Newton MessagePad way back in 1993. This innovative machine was fraught with problems and really died a very slow death, finally being withdrawn from the market in 1998."

I_ET,"ICE-T.    	Rapper Ice-T must be sick of having his name come up as an answer in crossword puzzles. Maybe he should have stuck to his real name, Tracy Marrow? Then again, maybe not ... Ice-T has been interested in acting for decades and made his film debut in the 1984 movie about break-dancing called 'Breakin''. He has also played Detective Fin Tutuola in the TV show 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' since the year 2000."

One egg hatched into the beautiful Helen, later to be known as Helen of Troy and over whom was fought the Trojan War. The other egg hatched into the twins Castor and Pollux. Castor and Pollux had different fathers according to the myth. Pollux was the son of Zeus and was immortal, while Castor was the son of Leda's earthly husband, and so he was a mortal. William Butler Yeats wrote a famous sonnet called 'Leda and the Swan' in 1924. Peter Paul Rubens made a copy of a painting called 'Leda and the Swan' by Michelangelo, which is now lost."
O_ID,"OVID.    	The Roman poet Publius Ovidius Naso is today known simply as Ovid. Ovid is usually listed alongside the two other great Roman poets: Horace and Virgil. Ovid was very popular in his day, but somehow he fell foul of Emperor Augustus. For a reason unknown today, Augustus banished Ovid to Tomis, an island in the Black Sea. He lived there for about ten years, until he died."

EBO_,"EBON.    	Ebony is another word for the color black (often shortened to ""ebon"" in poetry). Ebony is a dark, black wood that is very dense, and is one of the few types of wood that sinks in water.

There are two ways of arranging the 1, 2 and 3 around the common vertex, a so called right-handed die (clockwise 1-2-3) or a left-handed die (counterclockwise 1-2-3). Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."

AY_,"AYN.    	Ayn Rand was a Russian-American novelist born Alisa Rosenbaum. Her two best known works are her novels ""The Fountainhead"" published in 1943 and ""Atlas Shrugged"" from 1957. Back in 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City. Soon after, she gathered a group of admirers around her with whom she discussed philosophy and shared drafts of her magnum opus, ""Atlas Shrugged"". This group called itself ""The Collective"", and one of the founding members was none other than future Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.

It's making a comeback now due to conservation measures taken by the Australian government."

EC_AT,"ECLAT.    	Eclat can mean a brilliant show of success, or the applause or accolade that one receives. The word derives from the French ""eclater"" meaning ""to splinter, burst out""."
_TR,"LTR.    	Like so many things it seems, our paper sizes here in North America don't conform with the standards in the rest of the world. ISO standard sizes used elsewhere have some logic behind them in that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard size of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government. Prior to this, the ""legal"" size (8.5 x 14 inches) had been the standard, since 1921."

RN_,RNS.    	Registered nurses are RNs.
LE_,"LEA.    	An elegy is a mournful poem or funeral song, also known as a dirge. Perhaps the most famous elegy in the English language is that written by Thomas Gray, completed in 1750. His 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' is the source of many oft-quoted phrases, including:"

The French ruled Laos as part of French Indochina, having united three separate Lao kingdoms. As there was a plural of ""Lao"" entities united into one, the French added the ""S"" and so today we tend to use ""Laos"" instead of ""Lao""."
L_LA,"LOLA.    	""Whatever Lola Wants"" is a song from the musical ""Damn Yankees"". ""Damn Yankees"" is actually yet another version of the classic German legend of Faust, set in Washington, D.C. in the fifties. The show was written by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, a production that turned out to be a very successful follow up to their prior hit, ""The Pajama Game"". The future was looking really rosy for Adler and Ross, but sadly, Jerry Ross died of an obstructive lung disease only a few weeks after ""Damn Yankees"" opened on Broadway in 1955. He was just 29 years old."
OLA_,"OLAV.    	Of the many kings of Norway named Olaf/Olav (and there have been five), Olaf II is perhaps the most celebrated as he was canonized and made patron saint of the country.

S_LA,"SELA.    	The actress Sela Ward turns up in crosswords a lot. Ward played Teddy Reed in the TV show ""Sisters"" in the nineties, and was in ""Once and Again"" from 1999-2002. I don't know either show, but I do know Ward from the medical drama ""House"" in which she played the hospital's lawyer and Greg House's ex-partner. That was a fun role, I thought. More recently Ward played a lead role on ""CSI: NY"" and was a very welcome and much-needed addition to the cast ..."

PI_A,"PITA.    	Pita is a lovely bread in Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. Pita is usually round, and has a ""pocket"" in the center. The pocket is created by steam that puffs up the dough during cooking leaving a void when the bread cools. The pockets were a big hit in the seventies when someone came up with the idea of using them for fillings hence creating pita sandwiches or ""pita pockets""."
_YE,"LYE.    	What we call 'lye' is usually sodium hydroxide, although historically the term was used for potassium hydroxide. Lye has many uses, including to cure several foodstuffs. Lye can make olives less bitter, for example. The chemical is also found in canned mandarin oranges, pretzels and Japanese ramen noodles. More concentrated grades of lye are used to clear drains and clean ovens. Scary ..."
OL_A,"OLGA.    	Olga Korbut is from modern-day Belarus, but was born during the days of the Soviet Union. She competed for the USSR team in the 1972 and 1976 Olympic Games. Korbut was 17 when she appeared in the 1972 Munich Games, and had been training in a sports school since she was 8-years-old. The world fell in love with her as she was a very emotional young lady, readily expressing joy and disappointment, something that we weren't used to seeing in athletes from behind the Iron Curtain. Korbut immigrated to the US in 1991, and now lives in Scottsdale, Arizona."
ODE_SA,"ODESSA.    	The city of Odessa in Ukraine was founded relatively recently, in 1794 by Catherine the Great. The city was originally meant to be called Odessos after an ancient Greek city that was believed to have been nearby. Catherine like the way the locals pronounced the name ""Odessa"", so went with the less Greek sounding name."
_EDA,"LEDA.    	In Greek mythology, Leda was the beautiful Queen of Sparta who was seduced by Zeus, in the form of a swan. She produced two eggs from the union. One egg hatched into the beautiful Helen, later to be known as Helen of Troy over whom the Trojan War was fought. The other egg hatched into the twins Castor and Pollux. Castor and Pollux had different fathers in the myth. Castor was the son of Zeus, so was immortal, while Pollux was the son of Leda's husband, so he was mortal."

The koala is an arboreal marsupial and a herbivore, native to the east and south coasts of Australia. Koalas aren't primates, and are one of the few mammals other than primates who have fingerprints. In fact, it can be very difficult to tell human fingerprints from koala fingerprints, even under an electron microscope."
RO_,"ROM.    	Romania sits just east of Hungary and north of Bulgaria in Europe. Romania was formed from the union of two principalities in 1859, Moldavia and Wallachia. The Kingdom of Romania grew larger in size after WWI with the addition of three new regions, including the ""vampirish"" Transylvania."
H_M,"HAM.    	The word ""ham"", describing a performer who overacts, is apparently a shortened form of ""hamfatter"" and dates back to the late 1800s. ""Hamfatter"" comes from a song in old minstrel shows called ""The Ham-Fat Man"".

RE_,"REE.    	The full name for the old mystery game is ""Mr. Ree! The Fireside Detective"". It was first published in 1937, and frankly, it sounds like a great game even by today's standards ..."
_SU,"OSU.    	The athletic teams of Ohio State University are called the Buckeyes, named after the state tree of Ohio. In turn the buckeye tree gets its name from the appearance of its fruit, a dark nut with a light patch thought to resemble a ""buck's eye""."
EP_OM,"EPSOM.    	The Surrey town of Epsom in England is most famous for its racecourse (Epsom Downs), at which is run the Epsom Derby every year, one of the three races that make up the English Triple Crown.

One reason we aren't in OPEC is that we may be a big producer, but we import a lot more than we export, but you probably heard that already ..."

SU_,"SUR.    	Big Sur is a lovely part of the California Coast, south of Monterey and Carmel. The name ""Big Sur"" comes from the original Spanish description of the area as ""el sur grande"" meaning ""the big south""."
L_R,"LTR.    	Like so many things it seems, our paper sizes here in North America don't conform with the standards in the rest of the world. ISO standard sizes used elsewhere have some logic behind them in that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard size of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government. Prior to this, the ""legal"" size (8.5 x 14 inches) had been the standard, since 1921."

_FT,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world, living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants, unlike the eggs of frogs and toads which float freely. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs.

_FT,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants unlike the eggs of frogs and toads which float freely. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."

LT_,"LTR.    	Our paper sizes here in North America don't conform with the standards in the rest of the world. ISO standard sizes used elsewhere were chosen so that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard size of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government.

ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer.

The Manhattan neighborhood known today as SoHo was very fashionable in the early 1900s, but as the well-heeled started to move uptown the area became very run down and poorly maintained. Noted for the number of fires that erupted in derelict buildings, SoHo earned the nickname ""Hell's Hundred Acres"". The area was then zoned for manufacturing and became home to many sweatshops. In the mid-1900s artists started to move into open loft spaces and renovating old buildings as the lofts were ideal locations in which an artist could both live and work. In 1968, artists and others organized themselves so that they could legalize their residential use of an area zoned for manufacturing. The group they formed took its name from the name given to the area by the city's Planning Commission i.e ""South of Houston"". This was shortened from So-uth of Ho-uston to SoHo as in the SoHo Artists Association, and the name stuck."
M_IR,"MEIR.    	Golda Meir was known as the ""Iron Lady"" when she was Prime Minister of Israel, long before the term came to be associated with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

By the time she was called on to lead the country, she had already retired, citing exhaustion and ill health. She led the country during turbulent times (the massacre at the Munich Olympics, the Yom Kippur War), and eventually resigned in 1974 saying that was what the people wanted."
LU_U,"LUAU.    	Nowadays the word ""luau"" denotes almost any kind of party on the Hawaiian Islands, but to the purist a luau is a feast that always includes a serving of ""luau"": young taro tops baked with coconut milk and served with chicken or octopus."

AN_SE,"ANISE.    	Liquorice (also licorice) and aniseed have similar flavors, but they come from unrelated plants. The liquorice plant is a legume like a bean, and the sweet flavor is an extract from the roots. The flavor mainly comes from an ether compound called anethole, the same substance that gives the distinctive flavor to anise. The seedpods of the anise plant are what we know as ""aniseed"". The anise seeds themselves are usually ground to release the flavor."
NEL_,"NELL.    	Dudley Do-Right appeared on the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, a cartoon that appeared on television in a couple of different versions from 1959-1964. Dudley was a bungling Mountie who struggled with his nemesis, the evil Snidely Whiplash, while pursuing the romantic intentions of Nell Fenwick (who always seemed to prefer Dudley's horse!)."
RO_E,"ROSE.    	Rosé wines get their color from the skins of the grapes, although the intensity of the color is not sufficient to make them red wines. Of the varying type of rosé wines available, we are most familiar with sweet White Zinfandels. Personally I am fond of the really dry Provençal rosé wines."
MEI_,"MEIR.    	""Golda's Balcony"" is a play by William Gibson. It is a one-woman show, and ran on Broadway for 493 performances starting in 2003, making it the longest running one-woman show in Broadway's history.

The fictional Xena supposedly came from the 'non-fictional' Greek city of Amphipolis."
E_HER,"ETHER.    	""The Cider House Rules"" is a novel by John Irving first published in 1985. The novel was made into a film of the same name released in 1999, as well as a stage play adapted by playwright Peter Parnell."
_PAM,"SPAM.    	Apparently the term ""spam"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word Spam, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""spam"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."
O_AKA,"OSAKA.    	The Japanese city of Osaka used to be called Naniwa, with the name changing to Osaka some time before 1500. ""Osaka"" can be translated either as ""large hill"" or ""large slope""."

_ACO,"WACO.    	In recent years, Waco is perhaps most famous as the site of a siege and shootout between ATF agents and members of the Protestant sect known as the Branch Davidians. Shortly after ATF agents tried to execute a search warrant, shots were fired and at the end of the fight six people inside the Branch Davidian compound were dead, as were four agents.

A_LES,"ARLES.    	A few years ago I had the privilege of living just a short car ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although it has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design. It has a spectacular Roman amphitheater, arch, circus as well as old walls that surround the city center. In more modern times it was a place that Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Café Terrace at Night"", as well as ""Bedroom in Arles""."
O_RAH,"OPRAH.    	""Precious"" is the 2009 screen adaptation of the 1996 novel ""Push"" written by Sapphire.

T_NA,TINA.    	Tina Weymouth is one of the founding members of the New Wave group called Talking Heads.
_LAMA,"LLAMA.    	Alpacas are like small llamas, but unlike llamas were never beasts of burden. Alpacas were bred specifically for their fleece. As such, there are no known wild alpacas these days, even in their native Peru."

ALIC_,"ALICE.    	""Dennis the Menace"" is a comic strip that first appeared in 1951, originally drawn by Hank Ketcham. The strip made the jump over the years from the newspaper to television and the silver screen. Dennis's full name is Dennis Mitchell, and his parents are Henry and Alice (Johnson) Mitchell. Dennis's nemesis is his neighbor, Mister George Everett Wilson. Hank Ketcham drew his inspiration for the story from his real life. When he introduced the strip he had a 4-year-old son called Dennis, and a wife named Alice."

T_M,"TAM.    	A tam o'shanter is a man's cap traditionally worn by Scotsmen. ""Tams"" were originally all blue (and called ""blue bonnets""), but as more dyes became readily available they became more colorful. The name of the cap comes from the title character of Robert Burns' poem ""Tam O'Shanter""."
A_ER,"ACER.    	I am typing away right now in an Acer laptop, for my money the most reliable machine at the best price. Acer is a Taiwanese company that I used to visit a lot when I was in the electronics business. I was very impressed with the company's dedication to quality, and haven't been let down since."
ES_D,ESTD.    	Established (estd.)
A_ENA,"ARENA.    	The Circus Maximus was an ancient stadium used for chariot racing in Rome.

The Circus Maximus was over 2,000 feet long and just under 400 feet wide, and could house about 15,000 spectators. There is very little of the original structure remaining and the site is now used as a major park."

Soon after, she gathered a group of admirers around her with whom she discussed philosophy and shared drafts of her magnum opus, ""Atlas Shrugged"". This group called itself ""The Collective"", and one of the founding members was none other than future Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan."
_RLES,"ARLES.    	Quite a few years ago now, I had the privilege of living just a short car-ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although Arles has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design. Arles has a spectacular Roman amphitheater, arch, circus as well as old walls that surround the center of the city. In more modern times, it was a place Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Cafe Terrace at Night"", as well as ""Bedroom in Arles""."
AXE_,AXEL.    	An Axel is a forward take-off jump in figure skating. It was first performed by Norwegian Axel Paulsen at the 1882 World Figure Skating championships.
ENIA_,"ENIAC.    	The acronym ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (although many folks insist the C was for ""Computer""). ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was designed to calculate artillery firing tables, but it ended up being used early on to make calculations necessary for the development of the hydrogen bomb. Given its uses, it's not surprising to hear that development of ENIAC was funded by the US Army during WWII."
DA_L,"DAHL.    	'The Witches' is a comedy film released in 1990 starring Anjelica Huston and Rowan Atkinson. The film is based on a book of the same name by Roald Dahl. Jim Henson of 'The Muppets' fame was one of the producers, and it was the last film he worked on before he passed away in 1990."
KOA_A,"KOALA.    	The koala bear really does look like a little bear, but it's not even closely related. The koala is an arboreal marsupial and a herbivore, native to the east and south coasts of Australia. Koalas aren't primates, and are one of the few mammals other than primates who have fingerprints. In fact, it can be very difficult to tell human fingerprints from koala fingerprints, even under an electron microscope. Male koalas are called 'bucks', females are 'does', and young koalas are 'joeys'. I'm a little jealous of the koala, as it sleeps up to 20 hours a day ..."
IR_,"IRT.    	The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) was the original private operator of the New York Subway when it opened in 1904. The city took over ownership of the system in 1940, but the lines originally operated by the IRT are still known by the IRT moniker."

After a promising start to her career it seemed to peter out, and the public became more interested in her 7-year marriage to Bobby Darin. And of course she will forever be remembered from the song in the movie and stage-show ""Grease"" called ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee""."
_MOO,"OMOO.    	Herman Melville mined his own experiences when writing his novels. Melville sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1841 on a whaler heading into the Pacific Ocean (a source for ""Moby Dick""). Melville ended up deserting his ship 18 months later and lived with natives on a South Pacific Island for three weeks (a source for ""Typee"").

SLE_T,"SLEET.    	Apparently ""sleet"" is a term used to describe two weather conditions. One is a shower of ice pellets, smaller than hail, and the second is a mixture of rain and snow, with the snow melting as it falls. It's the second definition that I have always used ..."

S_ARR,"STARR.    	Ringo Starr's real name is Richard Starkey. Before he joined the Beatles (replacing drummer Pete Best), Starkey played with the Raving Texans.

Back then his drum solos were billed as ""Starr Time""."

As a teenager, she moved to Denver, where she met married Morris Meyerson, at the age of 19. She and her husband joined a kibbutz in Palestine in 1921, at that time in her twenties.

She married Jose Ferrer in 1938, but were divorced ten years later after it was revealed that she was having a long-running affair with Paul Robeson.

After a promising start to her career it seemed to peter out, and the public became more interested in her 7-year marriage to Bobby Darin.

His original appointment was to investigate the suicide of White House Counsel Vince Foster. He was also charged with continuing the investigation of the Whitewater controversy in which then-Governor Clinton was accused of applying pressure to arrange an illegal loan to one of his partners in the Whitewater land deal. Famously, Starr's purview was extended to include an investigation into President's Clinton's extra-marital affair with Monica Lewinsky to determine if the President has lied under oath. We don't hear too much about Ken Starr anymore, but he is currently the President of Baylor University in Waco, Texas."
OGE_,"OGEE.    	An ogee is a type of S-curve. Specifically it is a figure consisting of two arcs that curve in opposite directions (like an S) but both ends of the curve end up parallel to each other (which is not necessarily true for an S). An ogee arch is composed of two ogees, with one being the mirror of the other and meeting at the arch's apex."
_ELA,"SELA.    	The actress Sela Ward turns up in crosswords a lot. Ward played Teddy Reed in the TV show 'Sisters' in the nineties, and was in 'Once and Again' from 1999-2002. I don't know either show, but I do know Ward from the medical drama 'House' in which she played the hospital's lawyer and Greg House's ex-partner. That was a fun role, I thought. More recently Ward played a lead role on 'CSI: NY' and was a very welcome and much-needed addition to the cast ..."
F_A,"FAA.    	The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was set up in 1958 (as the Federal Aviation Agency).

Castor and Pollux had different fathers according to the myth. Pollux was the son of Zeus and was immortal, while Castor was the son of Leda's earthly husband, and so he was a mortal."

The race starts every year on the first Saturday in March, with the first race having been held in 1973. The fastest finishing time was set in 2002 at just under 9 days. The first few races only used a northern route, but then a southern route was added to the roster every second year. It's kind of a good thing, because when the racers take the northern route they don't even pass through the town of Iditarod!"

IRA_I,"IRANI.    	Tehran is the capital of Iran and is the largest city in the Middle East, with a population of about 8.5 million. Iran has been around an awful long time and Tehran is actually the country's 31st national capital."

The city was originally meant to be called Odessos after an ancient Greek city believed to have been located nearby. Catherine liked the way the locals pronounced the name as 'Odessa' and so went with the less Greek-sounding name."
LOL_,"LOLA.    	In the musical show 'Damn Yankees', the title refers to the New York Yankees baseball team that dominated the sport in the fifties. That said, the show tells the story of the a man who sells his soul to help his beloved Washington Senators team beat the Yankees and win the pennant. So, ""Damn Yankees"" is yet another version of the classic German legend of ""Faust"". The show was written by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, a production that turned out to be a very successful follow-up to their prior hit, ""The Pajama Game"". The future was looking really rosy for Adler and Ross but, sadly, Jerry Ross died of an obstructive lung disease only a few weeks after ""Damn Yankees"" opened on Broadway in 1955.

_RU,"TRU.    	""Tru"" was written by Jay Presson Allen, a play about Truman Capote that premiered in 1989. There is an interesting anachronism in the piece. It is set in Capote's New York City apartment in Christmas 1975, and at one point the Capote character talks about suicide saying he has enough pills to stage his own Jonestown Massacre. The Jonestown Massacre didn't happen until three years later, in 1978."

One egg hatched into the beautiful Helen, later to be known as Helen of Troy and over whom the Trojan War was fought. The other egg hatched into the twins Castor and Pollux. Castor and Pollux had different fathers according to the myth. Pollux was the son of Zeus and was immortal, while Castor was the son of Leda's earthly husband, and so he was a mortal. William Butler Yeats wrote a famous sonnet called 'Leda and the Swan' in 1924."
_XEL,AXEL.    	An Axel is a forward take-off jump in figure skating. It was first performed by Norwegian Axel Paulsen at the 1882 World Figure Skating championships.
TR_,"TRU.    	""Tru"" was written by Jay Presson Allen and is a play about Truman Capote that premiered in 1989. There is a classic anachronism in the piece. It is set in Capote's New York City apartment at Christmas 1975. At one point the Capote character talks about suicide, saying that he has enough pills to stage his own Jonestown Massacre. The Jonestown Massacre didn't happen until three years later, in 1978."

One was his own son, Girolamo, and another was the famed Antonio Stradivari."
TA_,"TAD.    	Back in the 1800s ""tad"" was used to describe a young child, and this morphed into our usage of ""small amount"" in the early 1900s. The original use of ""tad"" for a child is very likely a shortened version of ""tadpole""."

GS_,"GSA.    	The Girl Scouts of America (GSA) was a scouting organization that only existed from 1910 until about 1913. I am not sure that the GSA ever sold cookies.

RP_,RPM.    	Revolutions per minute (rpm)
PIT_,"PITA.    	Pita is a lovely bread in Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. Pita bread is usually round, and has a ""pocket"" in the center. The pocket is created by steam that puffs up the dough during cooking leaving a void when the bread cools. The pockets were a big hit in the seventies when someone came up with the idea of using them for fillings hence creating pita sandwiches or ""pita pockets""."
_YE,"EYE.    	Conspiracy theorists love to point out ""suspicious"" symbols on the dollar bill. The pyramid on the bill is unfinished, with 13 steps. The number 13 has been associated with the occult, but it is also the number of original colonies which declared independence from Britain forming the United States. Not so suspicious after all ..."
_OM,"ROM.    	CD-ROM stands for ""compact disc read only memory"". The name indicates that you can read information from the disc (like a standard music CD for example), but you cannot write to it.

ES_YS,ESPYS.    	The ESPY Awards are a creation of the ESPN sports television network. One difference with similarly named awards in the entertainment industry is that the winners are chosen solely based on viewer votes.
_SP,"TSP.    	There seems to some uncertainty about the origin of the symbol ""Rx"", used for a medical prescription. One explanation is that it comes from the astrological sign for Jupiter, a symbol put on prescriptions in days of old to invoke Jupiter's blessing to help the patient recover."
_TA,"UTA.    	Uta Hagen was a German-born American actress. She married Jose Ferrer in 1938, but they were divorced ten years later after it was revealed that she was having a long-running affair with Paul Robeson. Her association with Robeson, a prominent civil rights activist, earned her a spot on the Hollywood Blacklist during the McCarthy Era. This forced her away from film, but towards a successful stage career in New York City."
_ATTE,"LATTE.    	The term 'latte' is an abbreviation of the Italian ""caffelatte"" meaning ""coffee (and) milk"". Note that in the correct spelling of ""latte"", the Italian word for milk, there is no accent over the ""e"". An accent is often added by mistake when we use the word in English, perhaps meaning to suggest that the word is French."
ILIA_,"ILIAD.    	The Iliad is an epic poem by the Greek poet Homer, which tells the story of the siege of Ilium (also known as Troy) during the Trojan war."
_TR,"LTR.    	Like so many things it seems, our paper sizes here in North America don't conform with the standards in the rest of the world. ISO standard sizes used elsewhere have some logic behind them in that the ratio of width to length is usually one to the square root of two. This mathematical relationship means that when you cut a piece of paper in two each half preserves the aspect ratio of the original, which can be useful in making reduced or enlarged copies of documents. Our standard size of ""letter"" (8.5 x 11 inches) was determined in 1980 by the Reagan administration to be the official paper size for the US government. Prior to this, the ""legal"" size (8.5 x 14 inches) had been the standard, since 1921."

A_LES,"ARLES.    	A few years ago I had the privilege of living just a short car ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France.

In more modern times, it was a place that Vincent van Gogh often visited, and where he painted his famous ""Cafe Terrace at Night"", as well as ""Bedroom in Arles""."

OD_SSA,"ODESSA.    	Sergei Eisenstein's famous 1925 film ""The Battleship Potemkin"" told the story of the 1905 workers' revolt in Odessa. The uprising was supported by the crew of the Battleship Potemkin, who staged a mutiny against their Tsarist officers.

The race starts every year on the first Saturday in March, with the first race having been held in 1973. The fastest finishing time was set in 2002 at just under 9 days. The first few races only used a northern route, but then a southern route was added to the roster every second year. It's kind of a good thing, because when the racers take the northern route they don't even pass through the town of Iditarod!"
_REA,"AREA.    	Remember doing calculus at school, and all those derivatives and integrals? Well, you probably also remember that an integral calculates the area under a curve (for example), and a derivative calculates the slope of a tangent at a particular point on a curve."
_MIL,"EMIL.    	Emil Gilels was a pianist from the old Soviet Union, born in Odessa (now part of Ukraine). Gilels was one of the first musicians allowed to perform concerts outside of the Eastern Bloc. His debut appearance in Philadelphia with Eugene Ormandy was a resounding success."
P_I,"POI.    	I was reliably informed by a blog reader that poi is not in fact cooked in an imu. Taro root might be baked in an imu, but that produces baked taro root, not poi ..."
_YE,"LYE.    	What we call 'lye' is usually sodium hydroxide, although historically the term was used for potassium hydroxide. Lye has many uses, including to cure several foodstuffs.

It is in such short supply that unscrupulous vendors have been known to darken lighter woods with shoe polish to look like ebony, so be warned ..."
_YE,"EYE.    	Argus Panoptes is a monster of Greek mythology. ""Panoptes"" means ""all-seeing"", so over time Argus has been described as having many, many eyes.

He picked up another whaler and headed for Hawaii, where he joined the crew of a US navy frigate that was bound for Boston (a source for ""Omoo"")."
S_AM,"SPAM.    	Apparently the term ""spam"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word Spam, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""spam"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."

_FT,"EFT.    	Newts wouldn't be my favorite animals. They are found all over the world living on land or in water depending on the species, but always associated with water even if it is only for breeding. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental stages during their lives. They start off as larvae in water, fertilized eggs that often cling to aquatic plants. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, the first developmental form of the newt. After living some months as tadpoles swimming around in the water, they undergo another metamorphosis, sprouting legs and replacing their external gills with lungs. At this juvenile stage they are known as efts, and leave the water to live on land. A more gradual transition takes place then, as the eft takes on the lizard-like appearance of the adult newt."

He pointed out that ""Horch"" was German for ""hear"" and he suggested ""Audi"" as a replacement, the Latin for ""listen""."
