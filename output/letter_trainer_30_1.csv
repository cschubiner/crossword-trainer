The group carried out non-combat flying duties such as delivery of aircraft and transportation of cargo. The idea was to free up male pilots for combat duty. Despite a lot of lobbying, the WASP was never given full military status during WWII. That injustice was finally rectified in 1977, and each member of the corps was awarded the WWII Victory Medal in 1984. The WASP was also awarded the Congressional Gold medal in 2009 by President Obama."
GEE_,"GEES.    	""Haw!"" is a command given to a trained animal that is hauling something (like a horse or an ox). ""Haw!"" is used to instruct the animal to turn to the left. The equivalent command for a right turn is ""Gee!"" Just to confuse things, the same commands are used in the British Isles but with the opposite meanings. That must be pretty unsettling for jet-setting plow horses ..."

It included, Mary Astor, Frankie Avalon, Charles Bronson, and even Frankie Laine. Laine sang the theme song, which was composed by a Russian, Dimitri Tiomkin."
DOR_,"DORK.    	I consider ""dork"" to be pretty offensive slang. It emanated in the sixties among American students, and has its roots in another slang term, for male genitalia."
CAPECORA_,"CAPE CORAL.    	Cape Coral is very much a planned community in Florida, founded in 1957. The intention by the developers was to create a Waterfront Wonderland. The result is a city with 400 miles of navigable waterways, more than any other city on the planet!"

_PHONES,"IPHONES.    	Siri is software application that works with Apple's iOS operating system. 'Siri' is an acronym standing for Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface. You've probably seen the ads on television, with folks talking to their iPhones asking for information and responding with a voice. I hear that Google is a little scared by Siri, as Siri is non-visual. There's no need to touch a screen or a keyboard to work with Siri, no opportunity to click on one of Google's ads! By the way, voice-over artist Susan Bennett revealed herself as the female American voice of Siri not that long ago. The British version of Siri is called Daniel, and the Australian version is called Karen.

Apparently the name 'Sabra' is used because someone born in the region is said to be tough on the outside and sweet on the inside, just like a prickly pear."
_RAGON,"ARAGON.    	I think there is a mistake here. Today, Aragon is an autonomous community in the northern part of Spain, with a border with France in the Pyrenees.

HO_D,HOLD.    	That would be in the stock market.
_ECKO,"GECKO.    	The gecko actually takes its name from the sound it makes, a unique trait in the world of lizards. The word ""gecko"" comes from an Indonesian/Javanese word ""tokek"", imitative of the chirping sound. More interesting to me than a gecko's chirping sound is their ability to cling to walls and other vertical surfaces. There feet are specially adapted, with ""toes"" that make extremely intimate, close contact to a surface. It isn't suction that supports them, but rather van der Waals forces (like weak ""gravitational"" attractions). Fascinating stuff ..."

A secondary designation of blood is the Rh factor, in which other antigens are labelled as either positive or negative. When a patient receives a blood transfusion, ideally the donor blood should be the same as that of the recipient, as incompatible blood cells can be rejected by the recipient. However, blood type O-Neg can be accepted by recipients with all blood types, AB or O, positive or negative. Hence someone with O-neg blood type is called a ""universal donor""."
R_RAL,"RURAL.    	The iconic Grant Wood work called 'American Gothic' was painted in 1930. It depicts a farmer holding a pitchfork standing beside his spinster daughter. Grant used his sister as a model for the daughter, and his dentist as a model for the farmer. You can see 'American Gothic' on display at the Art Institute of Chicago. You can also visit the house depicted in the painting, in the city of Eldon, Iowa. Perhaps predictably, the house is located on American Gothic Street."
ABZ_G,"ABZUG.    	Bella Abzug was one of the leader's of the Women's Movement that founded the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971. She was elected to the US Congress the same year, helped by a famous campaign slogan ""This woman's place is in the House - the House of Representatives""."

In the years following he continued his education further in Beijing, but did turn down an opportunity to study in France."

""The Onion"" newspaper was founded by two college students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1988. The founders sold the operation a year later for about $20,000. The paper grew steadily until 1996 when it began to publish online and really took off. I think it's worth a tad more than $20,000 today ..."
S_ARLE,"SEARLE.    	I doubt that Ronald Searle knew what an influence his ""St. Trinian's"" cartoon series would have in British culture. The first cartoon appeared in 1942, and over time depicted a school of ""wild"" girls, into drinking, gambling and all things wicked. The cartoon made it onto the big screen in the fifties, with a series of fun movies with a respected cast including the great Alistair Sim.

QUI_,"QUIZ.    	Sporcle.com is a trivia quiz website. The name is derived from the word ""oracle"" apparently. I like the web site's mission statement: ""We actively and methodically search out new and innovative ways to prevent our users from getting any work done whatsoever."""

R_SETTA,"ROSETTA.    	Rosetta is a coastal city and port on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. The Rosetta Stone is an Ancient Egyptian artifact of tremendous importance in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics.

The stone was discovered by the French military during Napoleon's 1798 campaign in Egypt. Before the French could get it back to France, the stone somehow ended up in enemy hands (the British), so it is now on display in the British Museum. Ownership of the stone is very much in dispute. The French want it, and of course the Egyptians would like it back."

The US no longer accepts the jurisdiction of the ICJ, after the court's 1986 decision that the US's covert war against Nicaragua was in violation of international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing ICJ rulings, and so the US used its veto power in the Nicaragua v. United States case."
ARSENA_S,"ARSENALS.    	Our word ""arsenal"" comes from the Italian ""arzenale"", a word adapted from the Arabic for ""workshop"". There was a large wharf in Venice called the Arzenale that became associated with the storage of weapons and ammunition, and this led to our contemporary usage."

The role of Scarlett was considered very desirable in the acting community, with Bette Davis on the short list, and Katherine Hepburn demanding an appointment with producer David O.

Selznick was adamant though, and stuck by his choice despite a lot of protests."
SP_ES,"SPIES.    	""Spy vs Spy"" is a comic strip that has run in ""Mad"" magazine continuously since 1961. It was drawn by Antonio Prohias, a refugee from Cuba. The early storyline was very fitting for the times, a statement about the futility of the arms race, detente and the Cold War."

S_Y,"SLY.    	If ever there was a movie that defines a career breakthrough for an actor, it would have to be ""Rocky"" for Sylvester Stallone. Stallone was a struggling actor in 1975 when a Muhammad Ali fight inspired Stallone to write a screenplay for a boxing movie, which he did in just three days. His efforts to sell the script went well but for the fact that the interested studios wanted a big name for the lead role, and Stallone was determined to be the star.

LE_ER,"LEGER.    	Fernand Leger was a French painter, and among his works was a series of paintings called ""La Grande Parade"". I quite like his ""Still Life with Beer Mug"", painted in 1921.

GOU_,"GOUT.    	Gout is caused by an elevation of the levels of uric acid in the blood. As a result of the high concentrations, the uric acid can crystallize out in tissue causing extreme discomfort. What we tend to call gout occurs when the crystals are deposited in the big toe."

From the second round onwards, Ali adopted a protected stance on the ropes, letting Foreman pound him with blows to the body and head, using his arms to take most of the punches.

In a sense, it is similar to this blog. Here I send out a post once a day containing information that I think might be useful to folks (thank you for reading!). I don't think I could send much of interest using just 140 characters. So, people who do tweet tend to send out messages like ""I'm at dinner now. I am having sushi"" and ""There's nothing on TV. I'm bored"". Nope, I don't think so!"
HAJ_,"HAJI.    	A Haji is the term used for someone who has made a pilgrimage to Mecca, and it is sometimes also used as a form of address for such a person."
FIVE_,"FIVE-O.    	Five-o has become urban slang for a police officer, or the police force in general. The term of course is rooted in the 1970s TV Show ""Hawaii Five-O"". Hawaii Five-O was a totally fictional police force created for the television show. The name recognizes that Hawaii was the 50th state to join the union. And the good news, or maybe bad, is that this very month, filming has started on a sequel series to be aired later this year."

JAIA_AI,"JAI ALAI.    	Even though jai alai is often said to be the fastest sport in the world (because of the speed of the ball), in fact golf balls often get going at a greater clip."

If things don't change, when my wife's van runs out of its final tank of gas, we'll be heading for the Honda dealership. The rear doors of the Element open from the front, the so called ""suicide door"" design. However, the rear doors won't open unless the front are open as well, so ""suicide"" is unlikely."

Fittingly, Bizet added a note to the score, declaring the original source."

Cline is one of a long list of musical legends who died in a plane crash. Cline was 30 years old when was killed in 1963, in a Piper Comanche plane piloted by her manager Randy Hughes.

THENA_URAL,"THE NATURAL.    	Bernard Malamud wrote the novel ""The Natural"", published in 1952. It tells the story of a baseball player called Roy Hobbs, who gets shot early in his career and makes a remarkable comeback many years later. Although Roy Hobbs is a fictional character, the story is apparently based on the real-life Phillies player Eddie Waitkus, who was indeed shot in his hotel room by an obsessed fan in 1949.

The term first became public in the US when the FBI managed to turn some members of the American Mafia.

S_UASH,"SQUASH.    	Squash was one of the big sportsin my home town in Ireland, so I played a lot when I was younger. It is very similar to racquetball, with one huge difference; the ball used in squash has very little bounce and really ""dies"" in the corners of the court.
