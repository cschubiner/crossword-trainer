The Mayor demanded that the flight take off again and land at a small airport in Brooklyn. A gaggle of press reporters joined him on the short hop and he gave them a story, urging New Yorkers to support the construction of a new commercial airport within the city's limits.

The film is a madcap comedy with a great cast including Peter Sellers, Peter O'Toole and Ursula Andress.

T_TO,"TOTO.    	There was an Italian actor with the stage name Totò, who did play some dramatic roles during the 1930s, but I think the reference here is to the dog in 1939's 'The Wizard of Oz'.

Given that Eris is actually bigger than Pluto, and other objects really aren't that much smaller, Pluto's status as a planet was drawn into question.
