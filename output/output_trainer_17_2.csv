Santa ___ (some winds).   		4 letters,"ANAS.    	The Santa Ana winds are the very dry air currents that sweep offshore late in the year in Southern California.

The winds arise from a buildup of air pressure in the Great Basin that lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Under the right conditions, that air spills over the peaks of the Sierra Nevada and basically ""falls"" down the side of the Sierra range, heading for the ocean. As the air falls it becomes drier and heats up so that relative humidity can fall to below 10% by the time it hits the coast."
