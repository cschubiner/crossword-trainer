L_O,"LEO.    	In 'The West Wing', Leo McGarry was played very ably by John Spencer. If you haven't seen them, the early seasons of ""The West Wing"" are just fabulous. I think I learned so much about the workings of the American government through this TV show."

So, he dropped the period, and I hope made a lot of money for himself and his wife."

_SN,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the age of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."

The degree of anonymity was insufficient though, as some users could be identified by the terms in their search histories.

CS_,"CSI.    	I""m not a big fan of director Quentin Tarantino. His movies are too violent for me, and the size of his ego just turns me right off. Having said that, I think ""Pulp Fiction"" is a remarkable film. If you can look past the violence it's really well written. And what a legacy it has. John Travolta's career was on the rocks and he did the film for practically no money, and it turned out be a re-launch for him. Uma Thurman became a top celebrity overnight from her role. Even Bruce Willis got some good out of it, putting an end to a string of poorly received performances."
U_A,"UMA.    	Uma Thurman's father, Robert Thurman, was the first westerner to be ordained a Tibetan Buddhist monk. He raised his children in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, and called his daughter Uma as it is a phonetic spelling of the Buddhist name, Dbuma."

OM_N,"OMAN.    	Oman is lies on the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula, neighbored by the OAE, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The city of Muscat, with its strategic location, has a history of invasion and occupation. Centuries of occupation by the Persians ended in 1507 when the Portuguese took the city in a bloody invasion. The Portuguese held the city for much of the next century until finally ousted by local Omani forces in 1648."
E_A,"EVA.    	Eva Perón was the second wife of President Juan Perón who was in office from 1946 to 1955. The Argentine First Lady was known affectionately by the people as 'Evita', the Spanish language diminutive of 'Eva'. ""Evita"" was also the follow-up musical to ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" for Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, and was based on the life of Eva Perón."
EE_,"EEL.    	Jellied eels are a traditional British dish associated with the working class East End of London. Historically, the eels used were caught in the River Thames. The dish is prepared by boiling up eels that have been chopped into rounds in a seasoned stock and then allowing it to set. The eel contains a lot of gelatinous protein so the stock forms a jelly as it cools."
ATAR_,"ATARI.    	Breakout is an arcade game developed by Atari and released in 1976. It is like a souped up version of the original video game, 'Pong'."
_KE,IKE.    	Mamie Eisenhower has to have been one of the most charming of all the First Ladies of the United States. Ms. Eisenhower suffered from an inner ear complaint called Ménière's disease which caused her to lose her balance quite often. Because she was unsteady on her feet there were unfounded rumors floating around Washington that Ms. Eisenhower had a drinking problem. People can be very unkind ...
OR_O,"OREO.    	The Oreo was the biggest selling cookie in the 20th century, and almost 500 billion of them have been produced since they were introduced in 1912 by Nabisco. In those early days the creme filling was made with pork fat, but today vegetable oils are used instead. If you take a bite out of an Oreo sold outside of America you might notice a difference from the homegrown cookie, as coconut oil is added to give a different taste."
_HO,"RHO.    	Rho is the Greek letter that looks just like our Roman letter ""p""."
OR_,"ORR.    	Catch-22' is a novel by Joseph Heller set during WWII. The title refers to absurd bureaucratic constraints that soldiers had to suffer. Heller's 'Catch 22' was invoked by an army psychiatrist to explain that any pilot requesting to be evaluated for insanity, to avoid flying dangerous missions, had to be sane as only a sane man would try to get out of such missions. The term 'catch-22 has entered the language and describes a paradoxical situation from which one can't escape due to contradictory rules; one loses, no matter what choice one makes."
_SA,"NSA.    	The National Security Agency (NSA) was set up in 1952 by President Truman, a replacement for the Armed Forces Security Agency that had existed in the Department of Defense since 1949. The NSA has always been clouded in secrecy and even the 1952 letter from President Truman that established the agency was kept under wraps from the public for over a generation. I really like the organization's nickname ... ""No Such Agency""."
_MAN,OMAN.    	Oman's only public university is called Sultan Qaboos University.
_SP,"ASP.    	The asp is a venomous snake found in the Nile region of Africa. It was so venomous that it was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as a means of execution. Cleopatra observed such executions noting that the venom brought on sleepiness without any painful spasms. When she opted to commit suicide, the asp was therefore her chosen method."
_LK,"ELK.    	The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (BPOE) was founded in 1868, and is a social club that has about a million members today. It started out as a group of men getting together in a ""club"" in order to get around the legal opening hours of taverns in New York City. The club took on a new role as it started to look out for poor families of members who passed away. The club now accepts African Americans as members (since the seventies) and women (since the nineties), but atheists still aren't welcome."
AST_,"ASTI.    	Asti is a sparkling white wine from the Piedmont region of Italy, and is named for the town of Asti around which the wine is produced. The wine used to be called Asti Spumante, and it had a very bad reputation as a 'poor man's champagne'. The 'Spumante' was dropped in a marketing attempt at rebranding associated with a reduction in the amount of residual sugar in the wine."
ETO_,"ETON.    	An Eton jacket is usually black, cut square at the hips and has wide lapels. It is named for the design of jacket that is worn by the younger students at Eton College just outside London."
INC_,"INCA.    	Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro discovered the Incas in 1526, marking the beginning of the end for an ancient civilization that was to be ravaged by brutal Spanish colonists and by imported smallpox. The last leader of the Inca was Atahualpa. Pizarro staged a mock trial and then condemned Atahualpa to execution by burning. A Spanish friar intervened on behalf of the condemned man, as Atahualpa believed that if he was burned his soul would not move on to the afterlife. Pizarro, was kind enough to have Atahualpa garroted instead."

The Gabor sisters were born in Budapest and immigrated to the United States separately, with Eva being the first to arrive. Eva broke into movies, but her most famous role was on the TV sitcom ""Green Acres"" in which she played the lovely character Lisa Douglas opposite Eddie Albert. One of Eva's claims to fame is the unwitting promotion of the game called ""Twister"", the sales of which were languishing in 1996. In an appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" she got on all fours and played the game with Johnny Carson. Sales took off immediately, and Twister became a huge hit."
SO_,"SOS.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."
EA_,"EAU.    	Back in 1709, an Italian perfume-maker moved to Cologne in Germany. There he invented a new fragrance that he named Eau de Cologne after his newly adopted town. The fragrance is still produced in Cologne, using a secret formulation. However, the terms ""Eau de Cologne"" and ""cologne"", are now used generically."
_MAN,"OMAN.    	The town of Bahla in Oman is famous for it's old fort, pottery and a surrounding oasis."
R_NE,"RENE.    	Belgian artist René Magritte was a surrealist. His most recognized work maybe is 'The Son of Man', a painting he created as a self-portrait.

There are also movie adaptations of two of the novels: ""Meet Nero Wolfe"" (1936) which features a young Rita Hayworth, and ""The League of Frightened Men"" (1937). One of Wolfe's endearing traits is his love of good food and beer, so he is a pretty rotund character."
A_A,"ADA.    	The American Dental Association (ADA) is the largest and oldest national dental association in the world. Today the ADA is based in Chicago, but the association was founded in Niagara Falls, New York in 1859. The ADA started out as a group of 26 dentists and now has more than 152,000 members."
S_R,"SSR.    	The former Soviet Union was created in 1922, not long after the Russian Revolution that overthrew the Tsar in 1917. Geographically, the new Soviet Union was roughly equivalent to the old Russian Empire, and was made up of fifteen Soviet Socialist Republics."

_LK,"ELK.    	The elk (also known as the wapiti) is the one of the largest species of deer in the world, with only the moose being bigger. Early European settlers were used to seeing the smaller red deer back in their homelands, so when they saw the ""huge"" wapiti they assumed it was a moose, and gave it the European name for a moose, namely ""elk"". The more correct term then is ""wapiti"", the Shawnee name for the animal, which means ""white rump"". It's all very confusing ..."

C_I,"CSI.    	The 'CSI' franchise of TV shows has been tremendously successful, but seems to be winding down. 'CSI: Miami' (the 'worst' of the franchise, I think) was cancelled in 2012 after ten seasons. 'CSI: NY' (the 'best' of the franchise) was cancelled in 2013 after nine seasons. The original 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation', set in Las Vegas, is still going strong and has been doing so since 2000."

A_L,"AOL.    	AOL's ""first"" Initial Public Offering was in 1992. Years later the company was picked up by Time Warner (not a great investment for Time Warner, as it turned out). AOL was spun off as a separate entity again in 2009 and the new company had a ""second"" IPO that same year."
O_CA,"ORCA.    	The orca that starred in the 1993 movie ""Free Willy"" was actually called Keiko, with Willy being his ""stage name"". Keiko had a sad life. He was captured near Iceland in 1979 and sold to a local aquarium. Subsequently he was sold on to Marineland in Ontario, and then Six Flags Mexico in 1985. After starring in the movie, his fans raised money with the intent of returning Keiko to the wild. Keiko had become very ill, partly from being confined in a small tank in Mexico, so a lot of money had to be spent returning him to good health. He was purchased by the Oregon Coast Aquarium who undertook the task of treating him and preparing him for the wild. You might recall the dramatic journey he took from Mexico to Oregon in US Air Force transport plane in 1996. Having regained his health, he was flown to Iceland and there was gradually reintroduced into the wild. Sadly, Keiko did not fare too well back in the ocean. He was never adopted by a pod, so lived a solitary life. He lost weight, would sometimes follow fishing boats and play with any humans who would give him attention. In 2003 he beached himself in Taken Bay in Norway, where he died."
L_S,"LES.    	The 1980 musical ""Les Misérables"" is an adaptation of the 1862 novel of the same name by Victor Hugo. The show opened in London in 1985, and is the longest running musical in the history of London's West End. My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The old theater's seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the storyline is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even smoking cigarettes. On cue, the stagehands would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the musical version of the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

_EO,"LEO.    	On the sitcom ""Seinfeld"", Jerry's eccentric maternal uncle is Leo, played by actor Len Lesser. Lesser acted in movies and television for many years, alongside some of the greats of stage and screen. He was fond of telling a marvelous story about acting in the 1973 film ""Papillon"" starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. In his role as a prison guard, Lesser was required to shove McQueen, but McQueen didn't think that Lesser was pushing him roughly enough. He turned to Lesser and told him ""Don't think of me as a movie star. Think of me as a character in a show"", encouraging him to be more aggressive. When McQueen walked away, Hoffman was left standing there beside Lesser. He paused and quietly said to Lesser, ""Think of me as a movie star ..."""
SS_,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although to me it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" these days. The system was introduced in 1936. Before 1986, a SSN was required only for persons with substantial income, so many children under 14 had no number assigned. There was concern that a lot of people were claiming children as dependents on their tax forms who did not exist, so from 1986 onwards it was a requirement to get a SSN for any dependents over the ago of 5. Sure enough, in the following year's tax returns, seven million dependents ""disappeared""."
_SR,SSR.    	The country that we now know as Belarus was called the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in the days of the Soviet Union.
OR_A,"ORCA.    	The taxonomic name for the killer whale is Orcinus orca. The use of the name ""orca"", rather than ""killer whale"", is becoming more and more common. The Latin word ""Orcinus"" means ""belonging to Orcus"", with Orcus being the name for the Kingdom of the Dead."

There has been a lot of talk about making 'Kill Bill: Volume 3'."

He had a turbulent year in office, and during this time oversaw the introduction of the ""don't' ask, don't tell"" policy for the military.

_SI,"CSI.    	The TV show ""CSI"" gets a lot of criticism from law enforcement agencies for its unrealistic portrayal of the procedures and science of criminal investigation. I don't care though, as I just think it's fun television.

_AU,"EAU.    	Back in 1709, an Italian perfume-maker moved to Cologne in Germany. There he invented a new fragrance that he named Eau de Cologne after his newly adopted hometown. The fragrance is still produced in Cologne, using a secret formulation. However, the terms ""Eau de Cologne"" and ""cologne"", are now used generically."
A_N,ANN.    	The television journalist Ann Curry is perhaps best known for the time she spent as co-host on NBC's 'Today' show. NBC executives asked Curry to resign from the 'Today' show because ratings were low. I just read online that Curry was also pushed out because of the way she insisted on dressing and because she refused to dye her gray hair. I hope that isn't true ...

N_A,"NSA.    	Edward Snowden is a former NSA contractor who leaked several top secret NSA documents to the media beginning in June 2013. After disclosing his name as the source of the leaks, Snowden tried to seek asylum in Ecuador. While travelling to Ecuador he had a layover in Moscow. While in Moscow, the US government revoked his passport, which effectively left him stranded in the transit area of Moscow Airport. The Russian government eventually granted him annually-renewable temporary asylum."
ORC_,"ORCA.    	The taxonomic name for the killer whale is Orcinus orca. The use of the name ""orca"", rather than ""killer whale"", is becoming more and more common. The Latin word ""Orcinus"" means ""belonging to Orcus"", with Orcus being the name for the Kingdom of the Dead."
L_S,"LES.    	The 1980 musical ""Les Misérables"" is an adaptation of the 1862 novel of the same name by Victor Hugo. The show opened in London in 1985, and is the longest running musical in the history of London's West End. My wife and I saw ""Les Miz"" in the Queen's Theatre in London quite a few years ago, but were only able to get tickets in the very back row. The old theater's seating is very steep, so the back row of the balcony is extremely high over the stage. One of the big events in the storyline is the building of a street barricade over which the rebels fight. At the height we were seated we could see the stagehands behind the barricade, sitting drinking Coke, even smoking cigarettes. On cue, the stagehands would get up and catch a dropped rifle, or an actor that had been shot. It was pretty comical. I didn't really enjoy the show that much, to be honest. Some great songs, but the musical version of the storyline just didn't seem to hang together for me."

Braun was herself a photographer and many of her photographs and films have survived and give us some insight into Hitler's personal life. Braun attempted suicide twice early on in the relationship with Hitler. She finally took her own life alongside Hitler just 40 hours after marrying him in the Führerbunker just before Berlin fell to the REd Army towards the end of WWII."
RH_,RHO.    	Rho is the Greek letter that looks just like our Roman letter 'p'.
A_L,"AOL.    	Founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1983, America Online changed its name in 1989. As the company went international, the acronym AOL was used in order to shake off the ""US-centric"" sound to ""America Online"". During the heady days of AOL's success, the company could not keep up with the growing number of subscribers, so people trying to connect often encountered busy signals. That's when users called AOL ""Always Off-Line""."
ES_U,"ESAU.    	Esau was the twin brother of Jacob, the founder of the Israelites. When their mother, Rebekah, gave birth to the twins ""the first emerged red and hairy all over (Esau), with his heel grasped by the hand of the second to come out (Jacob)"". As Esau was the first born, he was entitled to inherit his father's wealth (it was his ""birthright""). Instead, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for the price of a ""mess of pottage"" (a meal of lentils)."
_REO,"OREO.    	The Oreo cookie was the biggest seller in the 20th century, and almost 500 billion of them have produced since they were introduced in 1912 by Nabisco. In those early days, the creme filling was made with pork fat, but today vegetable oils are used instead. If you take a bite out of an Oreo sold outside of America though, you might notice a difference with the homegrown cookie as coconut oil is added to give a different taste."
AN_E,"ANNE.    	Anne Rice is an American author of erotic and Gothic novels. She was born Howard Allen O'Brien (no wonder she changed her name!). Her famous series of novels ""The Vampire Chronicles"" centers on her character Lestat de Lioncourt, a French nobleman who was turned into a vampire in the 18th century. One of the stories, ""Interview with the Vampire"", was adapted for the big screen in 1994 and features Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and others in a star-studded cast. Not my kind of movie though, as I don't do vampires ..."
_AN,IAN.    	Ian Kinsler is a second baseman for the Texas Rangers MLB baseball team.
AS_,"ASP.    	The asp is a venomous snake found in the Nile region of Africa. It is so venomous that the asp was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as a means of execution. Cleopatra observed such executions noting that the venom brought on sleepiness without any painful spasms. When the great queen opted to commit suicide, the asp was therefore her chosen method."
C_I,"CSI.    	'CSI: NY' is the best of the CSI franchise of television shows, in my humble opinion, since the original 'CSI' set in Las Vegas went off the boil a few years ago. Stars of the New York show are Gary Sinise and Sela Ward."
E_L,"EEL.    	Electrophorus electricus is the biological name for the electric eel. Despite its name, the electric ""eel"" isn't an eel at all, but rather what is called a knifefish, a fish with an elongated body and related to the catfish. The electric eel has three pairs of organs along its abdomen, each capable of generating an electric discharge. The shock can go as high as 500 volts with 1 ampere of current (that's 500 watts), and that could perhaps kill a human."
_REO,"OREO.    	The Oreo was the best-selling cookie in the 20th century, and almost 500 billion of them have been sold since they were introduced in 1912 by Nabisco.

I_N,"IAN.    	Sir Ian McKellen is a marvelous English actor, someone who is comfortable playing anything from Macbeth on stage to Magneto in an 'X-Men' movie. On the big screen, McKellen is very famous for playing Gandalf in ""The Lord of Rings"". In the UK Sir Ian is noted for being at the forefront of the campaign for equal rights for gay people, a role he has enthusiastically embraced since the eighties."
REN_,"RENE.    	The lovely and very talented actress Rene Russo is a native of Burbank, California. She went to high school with actor/director Ron Howard, but dropped out in tenth grade. At seventeen she was given the opportunity to train as a model, and within a very short time appeared on the cover of 'Vogue'. As her modelling jobs slowed down in her early thirties, she made a career change and studied theater and acting. I am so glad she did, as she is one of my favorite actresses ..."
_SN,"SSN.    	The main purpose of a Social Security Number (SSN) is to track individuals for the purposes of taxation, although given its ubiquitous use, it is looking more and more like an ""identity number"" to me. The social security number system was introduced in 1936. Prior to 1986, an SSN was required only for persons with substantial income so many children under 14 had no number assigned. For some years the IRS had a concern that a lot of people were claiming children on their tax returns who did not actually exist. So, from 1986 onward, it is a requirement to get an SSN for any dependents over the age of 5. Sure enough, in 1987 seven million dependents ""disappeared""."
NS_,"NSA.    	The National Security Agency (NSA) was set up in 1952 by President Truman, a replacement for the Armed Forces Security Agency that had existed in the Department of Defense since 1949. The NSA has always been clouded in secrecy and even the 1952 letter from President Truman that established the agency was kept under wraps from the public for over a generation. I really like the organization's nickname ... ""No Such Agency""."
U_A,"UMA.    	'Gattaca' is a science fiction movie starring Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman that was released in 1997. Set in the not-too-distant future, the film describes a society in which potential children are preselected so that they inherit the most desirable traits from their parents. The title 'Gattaca' is the space agency featured in the storyline. I saw this one relatively recently, and found it very absorbing ..."
SS_,"SSN.    	The Social Security Number system was introduced by the Social Security Administration in 1936, as part of the New Deal Social Security Program. The number is primarily used to track individuals for taxation purposes. There was a significant change made in 1986 when parents were required to apply for a social security number for their children over the age of 5 years. This change was made as the IRS believed that many parents were claiming deductions for children that did not actually exist, and the hope was that by requiring a SSN for each dependent such fraud could be curtailed. Sure enough, for tax year 1986, 7 million children ""disappeared""."
ET_N,"ETON.    	""A Yank at Eton"" was released in 1942, and is a sequel to the 1938 comedy ""A Yank at Oxford"". The film had some use as ""propaganda"" as the movie's message was that ""Yanks"" and ""Limeys"" could get along. This was helpful as American forces were pouring into the UK in preparation for the invasion of Europe during WWII."
_SI,"CSI.    	The 'CSI' franchise of TV shows has been tremendously successful, but seems to be winding down. 'CSI: Miami' (the 'worst' of the franchise, I think) was cancelled in 2012 after ten seasons. 'CSI: NY' (the 'best' of the franchise) was cancelled in 2013 after nine seasons. The original 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation', set in Las Vegas, is still going strong and has been doing so since 2000."
ETN_,"ETNA.    	Mt. Etna is the largest of three active volcanoes in Italy. Mt Etna is about 2 1/2 times the height of its equally famous sister, Mt. Vesuvius. One of the more recent eruptions was in 2003-2003, which threw up a huge column of ash."
_ED,"TED.    	The acronym TED stands for Technology Entertainment and Design. TED is a set of conferences held around the world by a non-profit group called the Sapling Foundation. The conference subjects are varied, and the meetings are often led by big names such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Bill Gates and Jane Goodall. The Sapling Foundation then makes recordings of the conferences available for free online with the intent of disseminating the ideas globally. These conferences are known as 'TED Talks'."
OB_,OBI.    	The sash worn as part of traditional Japanese dress is known as an obi. The obi can be tied in what is called a butterfly knot.
ETO_,"ETON.    	Captain Hook is the bad guy in 'Peter Pan', the famous play by J. M. Barrie. Hook is Peter Pan's sworn enemy, as Pan cut off Hook's hand causing it to be replaced by a 'hook'. It is implied in the play that Hook attended Eton College, just outside London. Hook's last words are 'Floreat Etona', which is Eton College's motto."
U_A,"UMA.    	Uma Thurman's father, Robert Thurman, was the first westerner to be ordained a Tibetan Buddhist monk. He raised his children in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, and called his daughter Uma as it is a phonetic spelling of the Buddhist name, Dbuma."

S_S,"SOS.    	The combination of three dots, three dashes, three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress signal in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS, although there is no pause between the letters, so this is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also only mnemonics, introduced after the Morse signal was adopted."
A_ARI,"ATARI.    	Do you remember the arcade video game that was like a game of tennis, with paddles moving up and down to hit what looked like a ball, over what looked like a net? Well, that was the game called ""Pong""."

AS_,"ASP.    	In Greek mythology, Medusa was one of the monstrous female creatures known as Gorgons. According to one version of the Medusa myth, she was once a beautiful woman. But she incurred the wrath of Athena who turned her lovely hair into serpents and made her face hideously ugly. Anyone who gazed directly at the transformed Medusa would turn into stone. She was eventually killed by the hero Perseus, who beheaded her. He carried Medusa's head and used its powers as a weapon, before giving it to the goddess Athena to place on her shield. One myth holds that as Perseus was flying over Egypt with Medusa's severed head, drop of her blood fell to the ground and formed asps."

_OS,"SOS.    	The combination of three dots - three dashes - three dots, is a Morse signal first introduced by the German government as a standard distress call in 1905. The sequence is remembered as the letters SOS (three dots - pause - three dashes - pause - three dots), although in the emergency signal there is no pause between the dots and dashes, so SOS is in effect only a mnemonic. Similarly, the phrases ""Save Our Souls"" and ""Save Our Ship"" are also mnemonics, introduced after the ""SOS"" signal was adopted."

Belarus didn&#8217;t exist as an entity until the Russian Revolution when it was created as one of the Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs) that made up the USSR. The Republic of Belarus was formed soon after the USSR dissolved in 1990, but unlike many of the former Soviet Republics, Belarus has largely retained the old Soviet policies. Alexander Lukashenko is the country&#8217;s president and he believes in state ownership of the economy. Belarus and Russia have formal agreements in place that pledge cooperation. "
OD_,"ODE.    	English poet John Milton is best known for his epic poem 'Paradise Lost'. Milton also wrote several sonnets, the most famous of which is probably 'On His Blindness'.

SS_,"SSN.    	A Social Security number (SSN) is divided into three parts i.e AAA-GG-SSSS, Originally, the Area Number (AAA) was the code for the office that issued the card. Since 1973, the Area Number reflects the ZIP code from which the application was made. The GG in the SSN is the Group Number, and the SSSS in the number is the Serial Number. However, this is all moot, as since 2011 SSN's are assigned randomly."
