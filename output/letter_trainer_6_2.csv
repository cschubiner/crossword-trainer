By the early seventies, Amin was commander of all the armed forces of Uganda and in 1971 seized power in a military coup, displacing the country's president Milton Obote. There followed seven years of brutal rule by Amin during which it is estimated that between 100,000 and 500,000 people were murdered. Amin was ousted from power in 1979 after a war with Tanzania, and fled to Libya where he stayed for a year.

When it was originally published, ""Tess ..."" received very mixed reviews, largely because it addresses some difficult sexual themes including rape, and sexual double standards (society's attitude towards men vs women). I suppose the most celebrated screen adaptation is Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" released in 1979. Polanski apparently made ""Tess"" because his wife, Sharon Tate, gave him Hardy's novel as her last act before she was murdered by the Manson family. There is a dedication at the beginning of the movie that simply reads ""To Sharon""."

I say, just stay out of the sun ..."
_AO,"MAO.    	Mao Zedong was born on December 16, 1893 in the Hunan Province of China. As he was the son of a peasant farmer, his prospects for education were limited.

We civilians, all round the world, owe a lot to President Ronald Reagan because he directed the military to make GPS technology available to the public for the common good. President Reagan was moved to do so after the Soviet Union shot down KAL flight 007 carrying 269 people, just because the plane strayed accidentally into Soviet airspace."
OR_,ORS.    	Surgeons operate in Operating rooms.
ELB_,"ELBA.    	I had a lovely two-week vacation in Tuscany once, including what was supposed to be a two-night stay on the island of Elba.

The Russian Mir Space Station was a remarkably successful project, with the station still holding the record for the longest continuous manned presence in space, at just under ten years. Towards the end of the space station's life however, the years began to take their toll. There was a dangerous fire, multiple system failures, and a collision with a resupply ship. The Russian commitment to the International Space Station drained funds for repairs, so Mir was allowed to reenter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up in 2001."

Idi Amin received most of his military training in the British armed forces, eventually achieving the highest rank possible for a Black African in the British Colonial Army in 1959, that of Warrant Officer. On his return to Uganda he joined the military and quickly rose to the rank of Deputy Commander of the Army. During that time he was quite the athlete. He was a noted rugby player and swimmer, and for nine years held the Ugandan national light-heavyweight boxing title. By the early seventies Amin was commander of all the armed forces of Uganda, and in 1971 seized power in a military coup, displacing the country's president Milton Obote.

_AO,"SAO.    	São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil. São Paulo is also the city with the highest number of helicopters in the world. This is partly driven by the horrendous traffic jams in São Paulo, but also by the wealthy having a very real fear of being kidnapped on the city's streets."
_AL,"HAL.    	In Arthur C. Clarke's ""Space Odyssey"" (famously adapted for the big screen as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") the computer system that went rogue was called HAL 9000, or simply ""HAL"". HAL stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer."

DDA_,"D-DAY.    	The most famous D-Day in history was June 6, 1944, the date of the Normandy landings in WWII. The term ""D-Day"" is used by the military to designate the day on which a combat operations are to be launched, especially when the actual date has yet to be determined. What D stands for seems to have been lost in the mists of time although the tradition is that D just stands for ""Day"". In fact, the French have a similar term, ""Jour J"" (Day J), with a similar meaning. We also use H-Hour to denote the hour the attack is to commence."
_RCO,"ARCO.    	ARCO stands for Atlantic Richfield Company. One of ARCO's claims to fame is that it is responsible for the nation's largest Superfund site.

Way back in 1974, the lovely Miss Olin was crowned Miss Scandinavia in a beauty pageant for Nordic women held in Helsinki, Finland."
R_I,"RPI.    	The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is a private school in Troy, New York. The university is named after its founder Stephen Van Rensselaer who set up the school in 1824.

_ST,"DST.    	On the other side of the Atlantic, Daylight Saving Time (DST) is known as ""summer time"". The idea behind summer/daylight-savings is to move clocks forward an hour in spring (i.e. 'spring forward') and backwards in the fall (i.e. 'fall back') so that afternoons have more daylight."
IN_E,"INGE.    	Playwright William Inge had a run of success on Broadway in the early fifties. Inge's most celebrated work of that time was the play ""Picnic"", for which he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.

Many of Inge's works are set in the American heartland and so he became known as the 'Playwright of the Midwest'."
R_X,"REX.    	In the excellent film ""Toy Story"", Rex is of course a tyrannosaurus, and a pretty clumsy one. He is voiced by actor Wallace Shawn, whose name is perhaps less familiar than his face.

As a young boy he lost his (socialist) parents during the Nazi purges early in the war. In 1943 he was living with his grandmother and still attending school when he was drafted into the army along with the rest of his class (at 14 years of age). His platoon leader was his school teacher who made a point of tutoring the boys in place of military drilling. One day he was on guard duty with his class/platoon at the dam above the city, and along come the Dam Busters with their bouncing bombs. The raid was successful (from the perspective of the Allies), but he described terrible hardship faced by the people below the dam due to flooding of the farmland that surrounded the factories."

ST_R,"STAR.    	Proxima Centauri is a mere 4.2 light years away from the Earth, making it the second nearest star to our planet (the Sun, of course, is nearer). The name comes from 'proxima' meaning 'nearest to' and Centauri from the constellation Centaurus to which the star belongs."
_RLE,"ERLE.    	I must have read all of the Perry Mason books when I was in college. I think they kept me sane when I was facing the pressure of exams. Author Erle Stanley Gardner was himself a lawyer, although he didn't get into the profession the easy way. Gardner went to law school, but got himself suspended after a month. So, he became a self-taught attorney and opened his own law office in Merced, California. Understandably, he gave up the law once his novels became successful."
SEG_,"SEGA.    	The Genesis is a video game console sold in the US by the Japanese company Sega. In the rest of the world, the console is sold as the Mega Drive, as Sega couldn't get the rights to the ""Mega Drive: name in the United States."

Frazier won in a unanimous decision after fifteen rounds. A couple of years later, in 1973, Frazier lost his title to George Foreman. Ali and Frazier had a non-title rematch in 1974, with Ali coming out ahead this time, also in a unanimous decision. Later that year, Ali grabbed back the the World Heavyweight Title in ""The Rumble in the Jungle"", the famous ""rope-a-dope"" fight against George Foreman. That set the stage for the third and final fight between Ali and Frazier, ""The Thrilla in Manila"". Ali won the early rounds, but Frazier made a comeback in the middle of the fight. Ali took control at the end of the bout, so much so that Frazier wasn't able to come out of his corner for the 15th and final round. He couldn't come out of his corner because both of his eyes were swollen shut, giving Ali a victory due to a technical knock out (TKO)."

_ORA,"NORA.    	Nora Ephron has many talents, including writing film scripts and novels. Many of the movies that she writes, she also directs.

He has been called ""the Cooler"" by some players as there is a perception that teams go cold when he joins them and hot when he leaves.

Rodriguez now seems to be in a world of hurt for using illegal performance-enhancing drugs."

TE_S,"TESS.    	The full name of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel is ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented"". When it was originally published, ""Tess"" received very mixed reviews, largely because it addressed some difficult sexual themes including rape, and sexual double standards (attitudes towards men vs women). I suppose the most celebrated screen adaption is Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" released in 1979. Polanski apparently made ""Tess"" because his wife, Sharon Tate, gave him Hardy's novel as her last act before she was murdered by the Manson family. There is a dedication at the beginning of the movie that just says ""To Sharon""."
EG_,"EGO.    	Sigmund Freud created a structural model of the human psyche, breaking it into three parts: the id, the ego, and the super-ego.

HAL stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer. Even though, Clarke denied it, there's a good argument that can be made that the acronym HAL is a veiled reference to IBM, the big player in the world of computing at the time of the novel's publication (1968). The acronym HAL is just a one-letter shift from the initials ""IBM""."

E_RE,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is a celebrated novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."

Colbert took over the 'Late Show' when David Letterman retired."

That made Justice Kagan the fourth female US Supreme Court justice (there have been 108 men!). I hear she is a fan of Jane Austen, and used to reread ""Pride and Prejudice"" once a year. Not a bad thing to do, I'd say ..."

TE_S,"TESS.    	The full name of Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel is ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented"". When it was originally published, ""Tess ..."" received very mixed reviews, largely because it addresses some difficult sexual themes including rape, and sexual double standards (society's attitude towards men vs women). I suppose the most celebrated screen adaptation is Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" released in 1979. Polanski apparently made ""Tess"" because his wife, Sharon Tate, gave him Hardy's novel as her last act before she was murdered by the Manson family. There is a dedication at the beginning of the movie that simply reads ""To Sharon""."
_PS,"GPS.    	GPS stands for Global Positioning System. The modern GPS system that we use today was built by the US military who received the massive funding needed because of fears during the Cold War of the use of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles.
