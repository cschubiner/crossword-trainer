End of a school e-mail address.   		3 letters,"EDU.    	A domain name is basically the address of a website on the Internet.

It's sort of like preferring to have a Park Avenue address instead of one on say Elm Street. In the Internet world, elements of the domain name are intended to indicate what type of activity goes on at a particular address. So an address with "".com"" implies a ""company"" website, a "".org"" implies a non-profit website and "".edu"" implies an education website. But in reality anyone can rent whatever address they want, as it just goes to the highest bidder. Most folks remember "".com"" addresses, so they are the most popular.
