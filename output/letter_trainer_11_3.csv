_LICE,"ALICE.    	Lewis Carroll wrote 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' in 1865, and the sequel called 'Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There' in 1871.

By the way, voice-over artist Susan Bennett recently revealed herself as the female American voice of Siri. The British version of Siri is called Daniel, and the Australian version is called Karen.

By the time she was called on to lead the country, Meir had already retired, citing exhaustion and ill health. But serve she did, and led Israel during turbulent times (e.g. the massacre at the Munich Olympics, and the Yom Kippur War). She eventually resigned in 1974, saying that was what the people wanted."
