B_A,"BOA.    	The etymology of the tern ""drag"" as used in the transvestite world seems to be unclear. It perhaps relates to the tendency of a transvestites skirts to drag along the ground in days of old (although why they just didn't hitch up their skirts is beyond me!)."

Many others, including Richards, were surprised that Jagger the rebel accepted the knighthood, a symbol of the establishment."
ONY_,"ONYX.    	Onyx is a form of quartz that comes in many different shades, but most often it's the black version that's used for jewelry. The name ""onyx"" comes from the Greek word for ""fingernail"", as onyx in the flesh color is said to resemble a fingernail."

A_R,"AER.    	Aer Lingus is my favorite airline! Well, the service isn't that great, but when I get on board an Aer Lingus plane I feel like I am back in Ireland.
