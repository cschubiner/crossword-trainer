M_A,"MIA.    	Mia Farrow is an energetic, award-winning actress who really hasn't looked back in her career since her first leading role, in ""Rosemary's Baby"" back in 1968. Farrow's on-screen celebrity is matched by the interest created by her personal life. Her first husband was Frank Sinatra, and the couple had a wedding in 1966 that received a lot of attention partly due to the couple's age difference (she was 21, he was 50). Farrow's second husband was almost as famous, the magnificent musician André Previn. Farrow then moved in with Woody Allen, a relationship that famously fell apart when Farrow discovered that Allen was having a sexual relationship with Soon-Yi, one of the adopted daughters from her marriage with André Previn."

The rank of earl is used in the British peerage system and is equivalent to the rank of count in other countries. Other British ranks have female forms (e.g. marquess and marchioness, viscount and viscountess), but there isn't a female word for the rank of earl.

B_A,"BRA.    	The word ""brassière"" is of course French in origin, but it isn't the word the French use for a ""bra"". In France what we call a bra is known as a ""soutien-gorge"", translating to ""held under the neck"". The word ""brassière"" is indeed used in France but there it describes a baby's undershirt, a lifebelt or a harness. ""Brassière"" comes from the Old French word for an ""arm protector"" in a military uniform (""bras"" is the French for ""arm""). Later ""brassière"" came to mean ""breastplate"" and from there the word was used for a type of woman's corset. The word jumped into English around 1900."

NI_,"NIA.    	Not only was the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", she also wrote the screenplay. The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history not to make it to number one. That record I think reflects that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came when a spin-off TV show was launched, ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It ran for only 7 episodes."
EL_OT,"ELIOT.    	""This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper"" are lines from T.S. Eliot's 1925 poem 'The Hollow Men'. The last two lines of ""The Hollow Men"" are oft-quoted:"

C_E,"CHE.    	Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara was born in Argentina, and in 1948 he started to study medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. While at school he satisfied his need to ""see the world"" by taking two long journeys around South America, the story of which are told in Guevara's memoir later published as ""The Motorcycle Diaries"". While travelling, Guevara was moved by the plight of the people he saw and their working conditions and what he viewed as capitalistic exploitation. In Mexico City he met brothers Raul and Fidel Castro and was persuaded to join their cause, the overthrow of the US-backed government in Cuba. He rose to second-in-command among the Cuban insurgents, and when Castro came to power Guevara was influential in repelling the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing Soviet nuclear missiles to the island. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to continue his work as a revolutionary. He was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967, and was executed. Fidel Castro led the public mourning of Guevara's death, and soon the revolutionary was an icon for many left-wing movements around the world."

OP_C,"OPEC.    	OPEC was created in 1960, with Indonesia joining the organization in 1962. Indonesia left OPEC in 2008 as the country was no longer able to meet the assigned production quota and had actually become a net importer of oil."
ELI_T,"ELIOT.    	George Eliot was the pen name of English novelist Mary Anne Evans. As one might think, Evans chose a male pen name in order that her work might be best appreciated in the Victorian era.

MO_,"MOE.    	If you've seen a few of the films starring ""The Three Stooges"" you'll have noticed that the line up changed over the years. The original trio was made up of Moe and Shemp Howard (two brothers) and Larry Fine (a good friend of the Howards). This line up was usually known as ""Moe, Larry and Shemp"". Then Curly Howard replaced his brother when Shemp quit the act, creating the most famous trio, ""Moe, Larry And Curly"". Shemp returned when Curly had a debilitating stroke in 1946, and Shemp stayed with the troupe until he died in 1955. Shemp was replaced by Joe Besser, and then ""Curly-Joe"" DeRita. When Larry Fine had a stroke in 1970, it effectively marked the end of the act."

A_ME,"ACME.    	""Ne plus ultra"" is French for ""no more beyond"" and means just that in English, the high-point."
_CRE,"ACRE.    	At one time, an acre was defined as the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plow in a day. This was more precisely defined as a strip of land one furlong long (660 feet) and one chain wide (66 feet). The word ""furlong"" is actually derived from the Old English words meaning ""furrow long"", the length of the furrow plowed by the oxen."
_MI,"EMI.    	EMI is a British music company, with the acronym originally standing for Electric and Musical Industries."
NI_,"NIA.    	Nia Long is an American actress, probably best known for playing Will Smith's sometime girlfriend and fiancee Lisa Wilkes on the TV show ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air""."
ERA_,"ERAT.    	'Quod erat faciendum' (QEF) is similar to the phrase 'quod erat demonstrandum' (QED), both of which were used by Euclid in his theorems. 'Quod erat faciendum' means 'what was to have been done', and is used at the end of a proposition that was not intended as a proof, but rather as a construction."
LA_,"LAO.    	The Lao people are an ethnic group found mainly in Laos, but who also have a significant presence in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam."
L_O,"LAO.    	The official name for the country of Laos is the Lao People's Democratic Republic. In the Lao language, the country's name is ""Meuang Lao"". The French ruled Laos as part of French Indochina, having united three separate Lao kingdoms. As there was a plural of ""Lao"" entities united into one, the French added the ""S"" and so today we tend to use ""Laos"" instead of ""Lao""."
T_I,"TAI.    	The Mai Tai cocktail is strongly associated with the Polynesian islands, but the drink was supposedly invented in 1944 in Trader Vic's restaurant in Oakland, California. One recipe is 6 parts white rum, 3 parts orange curaçao, 3 parts Orgeat syrup, 1 part rock candy syrup, 2 parts fresh lime juice, all mixed with ice and then a float added of 6 parts dark rum."
ASN_R,"ASNER.    	""Up"" is the tenth movie released by Pixar studios, featuring wonderful animation as we have come to expect from Pixar. The film earned itself two Academy Awards. The main voice actor is Ed Asner, whose animated persona as Carl Fredricksen was created to resemble Spencer Tracy, as Tracy appeared in his last film, 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'."
_BAR,"T-BAR.    	A T-bar is a type of ski lift in which the skiers are pulled up the hill in pairs, with each pair sitting either side of T-shaped metal bar. The bar is placed behind the thighs, pulling along the skier who remains standing on his/her skis (hopefully!). There's also a J-bar, a similar device, but with each J-shaped bar used by one skier at a time."
ASNE_,"ASNER.    	Ed Asner is most famous for playing the irascible but lovable Lou Grant on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and the spin-off drama ""Lou Grant"". Off-screen Asner is noted for his political activism. He served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild, and was very involved in the 1980 SAG strike. When ""Lou Grant"" was cancelled in in 1982, despite decent ratings, there was a lot of talk that the cancellation was a move by the network against Asner personally. In fact, one of Anser's activist colleagues, Howard Hesseman (who played Johnny Fever) found that his show, ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" was also cancelled, on the very same day."
_RAT,"ERAT.    	QED is used at the end of a mathematical proof or a philosophical argument. The QED acronym stands for the Latin ""quod erat demonstrandum"" meaning ""that which was to be demonstrated""."

H_R,"HER.    	The ship prefix 'HMS' is used by the warships of the Royal Navy, and stands for 'Her/His Majesty's Ship/Submarine'. The prefix 'RMS' is used by ships of the merchant navy, and stands for 'Royal Mail Ship/Steamer'."
ACR_,"ACRE.    	At one time, an acre was defined as the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plow in a day. Eventually, this was more precisely delineated as a strip of land one furlong long (660 feet) and one chain wide (66 feet). The word ""furlong"" is actually derived from the Old English words meaning ""furrow long"", the length of the furrow plowed by the oxen."
_IA,"NIA.    	Not only is the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", she also wrote the screenplay. The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history that didn't make it to number one. That record I think reflects the fact that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came when a spin-off TV show was launched, ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It ran for only 7 episodes."
_OS,"EOS.    	In Greek mythology, Eos is the goddess of the dawn who lived at the edge of the ocean. Eos would wake each morning to welcome her brother Helios the sun. The Roman equivalent of Eos is Aurora."
S_M,"SAM.    	On the sitcom ""Cheers"", barman Sam Malone was played by Ted Danson. Malone was a retired relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, and a recovering alcoholic. Great show ..."

E_S,EOS.    	Volkswagen introduced the EOS in 2006 as the successor to the Golf Cabriolet.
_MI,"EMI.    	EMI is a British music company, with the acronym originally standing for Electric and Musical Industries."
_SER,"YSER.    	The Yser is a river that originates in northern France and flows through Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser is often associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war, the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."
_LSA,ELSA.    	Elsa Lanchester was an English actress who made her life and career in Hollywood. Lanchester's husband was the actor Charles Laughton.
EY_E,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is of course the novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."
E_ES,ETES.    	One might spend the summer (été) under the sun (le soleil) in French-speaking countries.
_IRE,"EIRE.    	'Éire' is the Irish name for Ireland, coming from 'Ériu'. Ériu was the goddess of Ireland in Irish mythology."
DS_,"DSL.    	DSL originally stood for Digital Subscriber Loop, but is now accepted to mean (Asymmetric) Digital Subscriber Line. DSL is the technology that allows Internet service be delivered down the same telephone line as voice service, by separating the two into different frequency signals."
_ON,"RON.    	Ron Silver has a long career playing relatively small roles on the big screen and television, with roles in well known films like ""Mr. Saturday Night"", ""Ali"", and ""Garbo Talks"". Notably, Silver was the president of Actors' Equity from 1991 to 2000."
K_A,"KIA.    	The Kia Soul is a compact car produced in South Korea, although it was designed by Kia here in Irvine, California."
_LIOT,"ELIOT.    	Andrew Lloyd Weber's source material for his hit musical ""Cats"" was T. S. Eliot's ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"". Eliot's collection of whimsical poems was published in 1939, and was personal favorite of Weber as he was growing up. ""Cats"" is the second longest running show in Broadway history (""Phantom of the Opera"" is the longest, and is still running, deservedly so, in my humble opinion)."
_TS,"DTS.    	The episodes of delirium that can accompany withdrawal from alcohol are called Delirium Tremens (the DTs). The literal translation of this Latin phrase is ""trembling madness""."
AC_E,"ACME.    	The ""acme"" is the highest point, coming from the Greek word ""akme"" which has the same meaning."
_HI,"AHI.    	Yellowfin tuna is usually marketed as ""ahi"", its Hawaiian name. Yellowfin tuna is one big fish, often weighing over 300 pounds."
AH_B,"AHAB.    	Captain Hook is the bad guy in 'Peter Pan', the famous play by J. M. Barrie. Hook is Peter Pan's sworn enemy, as Pan cut off Hook's hand causing it to be replaced by a 'hook'. It is implied in the play that Hook attended Eton College, just outside London. Hook's last words are 'Floreat Etona', which is Eton College's motto. Barrie openly acknowledged that the Hook character was based on Herman Melville's Captain Ahab from the novel 'Moby Dick'."
_HE,"CHE.    	Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara was born in Argentina, and in 1948 he started to study medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. While at school he satisfied his need to ""see the world"" by taking two long journeys around South America, the story of which are told in Guevara's memoir later published as ""The Motorcycle Diaries"". While travelling, Guevara was moved by the plight of the people he saw and their working conditions and what he viewed as capitalistic exploitation. In Mexico City he met brothers Raul and Fidel Castro and was persuaded to join their cause, the overthrow of the US-backed government in Cuba. He rose to second-in-command among the Cuban insurgents, and when Castro came to power Guevara was influential in repelling the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing Soviet nuclear missiles to the island. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to continue his work as a revolutionary. He was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967, and was executed. Fidel Castro led the public mourning of Guevara's death, and soon the revolutionary was an icon for many left-wing movements around the world."

L_N,LEN.    	Len Goodman is a professional ballroom dancer. Goodman is the head judge on the US's 'Dancing with the Stars' as well as on the original UK version of the show called 'Strictly Come Dancing'.
M_A,"MIA.    	Mia Farrow is an energetic, award-winning actress who really hasn't looked back in her career since her first leading role, in ""Rosemary's Baby"" back in 1968. Her on-screen celebrity is matched by the interest created by her personal life. Her first husband was Frank Sinatra, a wedding in 1966 that received a lot of attention partly due to the couple's age difference (she was 21, he was 50). Her second husband was almost as famous, the magnificent musician André Previn. Farrow then moved in with Woody Allen, a relationship that famously fell apart when Farrow discovered that Allen was having a sexual relationship with Soon-Yi, one of her adopted daughters from the marriage with André Previn."
B_A,"BRA.    	""Lingerie"" is a French term, but as used in France it just means any underwear, worn by either males or females. In English we tend to use it to describe alluring underclothing worn by women. The term ""lingerie"" comes into English via the French word ""linge"" meaning ""washables"", and ultimately from the Latin ""linum"", meaning ""linen"". We tend not to pronounce the word correctly in English, either here in the US or across the other side of the Atlantic. The French pronunciation is more like ""lan-zher-ee"", as opposed to ""lon-zher-ay"" (American) and ""lon-zher-ee"" (British)."
_IA,"MIA.    	M.I.A. is a British singer whose music is a melding of hip-hop, electronica, alternative and world music."
N_AP,"NEAP.    	Tides of course are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the oceans. At neap tide, the lesser gravitational effect of the sun cancels out some of the moon's effect. At spring tides, the sun and the moon's gravities act in concert causing more extreme movement of the oceans."
TA_,"TAU.    	Neutrinos are small subatomic particles that do not carry an electric charge. The term 'neutrino' is Italian for 'small neutral one'. There are three types of neutrino: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos."
_DS,TDS.    	Touchdowns (TDs)
_YRE,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is of course the novel written by Charlotte Bronte under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on the blog that the storyline is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. So, not too long ago I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC, and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the performance. I thoroughly recommend this 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."
E_O,EEO.    	Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) is a term that has been around since 1964 when the Equal Employment Commission was set up by the Civil Rights Act.
C_A,CPA.    	Certified public accountant (CPA)
_PR,"APR.    	The exact etymology of 'April', the fourth month of our year, seems to be uncertain. The ancient Romans called it 'mensis Aprilis', which roughly translated as 'opening month. The suggestion is that April is the month in which fruits, flowers and animals 'open' their life cycles."

_AB,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious, involving lots of tapping on the spacebar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to 'jump' across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key which could be depressed, causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."
IG_R,"IGOR.    	In the world of movies, Igor has been the assistant to Dracula, Frankenstein and Young Frankenstein among others. Igor is almost invariably portrayed as a hunchback."

He won his most recent Emmy in 2006 for his portrayal of Presidential candidate Arnold Vinick in 'The West Wing'. When it comes to the big screen, my favorite of Alda's movies is the 1978 romantic comedy ""Same Time, Next Year"" in which he starred opposite Ellen Burstyn."

TD_,"TDS.    	In football, some interceptions result in touchdowns."
BR_,"BRA.    	The word ""brassière"" is of course French in origin, but it isn't the word the French use for a ""bra"". In France what we call a bra is known as a ""soutien-gorge"", translating to ""held under the neck"". The word ""brassière"" is indeed used in France but there it describes a baby's undershirt, a lifebelt or a harness. ""Brassière"" comes from the Old French word for an ""arm protector"" in a military uniform (""bras"" is the French for ""arm""). Later ""brassière"" came to mean ""breast plate"" and from there was used for a type of woman's corset. The word jumped into English around 1900."
REES_,"REESE.    	Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were invented by Harry Burnett ""H.B."" Reese. Peanut Butter Cups were originally called penny cups, reflecting the price at which they were sold. Then inflation took over, and maybe that's why they were broken into smaller 'Pieces' ..."

OPE_,"OPEC.    	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was founded in 1960 at a conference held in Baghdad, Iraq that was attended by Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Nine more countries joined the alliance soon after, and OPEC set up headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland and then Vienna, Austria in 1965. The basic aim of OPEC was to wrench control of oil prices from the oil companies and to put it in the hands of the sovereign states that own the natural resource."

Jefferson Davis was selected as President of the CSA at its formation, and retained the post for the life of the government. After the Civil War he spent two years in prison before being released on bail.

EY_E,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is of course the novel written by Charlotte Bronte under the pen name Currer Bell. I've been sharing here on the blog that the storyline is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC very recently, and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the performance. I thoroughly recommend this latest BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."

The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."
_AB,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious, involving lots of tapping on the space bar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to ""jump"" across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key which could be depressed, causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."

NI_,"NIA.    	Not only is the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", she also wrote the screenplay. The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history that didn't make it to number one. That record I think reflects the fact that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came when a spin-off TV show was launched, ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It ran for only 7 episodes."

While at school he satisfied his need to ""see the world"" by taking two long journeys around South America, the story of which are told in Guevara's memoir later published as ""The Motorcycle Diaries"". While travelling, Guevara was moved by the plight of the people he saw and their working conditions and what he viewed as capitalistic exploitation. In Mexico City he met brothers Raul and Fidel Castro and was persuaded to join their cause, the overthrow of the US-backed government in Cuba. He rose to second-in-command among the Cuban insurgents, and when Castro came to power Guevara was influential in repelling the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing Soviet nuclear missiles to the island. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to continue his work as a revolutionary. He was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967, and was executed. Fidel Castro led the public mourning of Guevara's death, and soon the revolutionary was an icon for many left-wing movements around the world."

This time he played the older man who was wooing the Jack Lemmon character in the movie."
TA_,"TAB.    	Tab was the first diet cola introduced by the Coca-Cola company, in 1963. It was produced as a competitor to the very successful Diet Rite cola that was made by RC Cola.

EA_,"EAR.    	I recently read an article on hearing loss that cites a study published in the 'Journal of Pediatrics'. According to the study, 12&#189;% of kids between 6 and 19 suffer from a loss of hearing that is directly attributable to the use of earphones set at a dangerously high volume. Personally, I love listening to all sorts of programming using earbuds. I am careful to use 'in-ear' types of earphones that are designed to block out external noise so that I can listen to programming at the lowest possible volume, and don't have to drown out external sounds. My doctor gives me a pat on the back for doing so, and has asked me to spread the word!"

The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."
