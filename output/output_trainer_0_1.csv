The fight was set in Zaire because of financial arrangements between promoter Don King and Zaire's President Mobuto Seko. Ali coined the term ""Rope-a-dope"" to describe his incredibly successful strategy in the contest. From the second round onwards, Ali adopted a protected stance on the ropes, letting Foreman pound him with blows to the body and head, using his arms to dissipate the power of the punches. He kept this up until the eighth round and then opened up and downed the exhausted Foreman with a left-right combination. I hate boxing, but I have to say, that was an fascinating fight."
