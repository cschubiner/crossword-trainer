E_RE,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is of course the novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."

Part of the film was shot in the harbor of Youghal in County Cork, Ireland.

The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."

Ito would almost always refer to the prosecutor as ""Marcia"", while addressing the men on both sides of the case as ""Mister""."

O_EC,"OPEC.    	The OPEC cartel (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) was formally established in 1960 and has been headquartered in Vienna since 1965. The US is actually the third largest oil producer in the world (after Russia and Saudi Arabia). One reason America isn't in OPEC, even though we are a big producer, is that we import a lot more than we export. But you probably knew that already ..."

The French ruled Laos as part of French Indochina, having united three separate Lao kingdoms. As there was a plural of ""Lao"" entities united into one, the French added the ""S"" and so today we tend to use ""Laos"" instead of ""Lao""."

_TRIA,ATRIA.    	In modern architecture an atrium (plural 'atria' or 'atriums') is a large open space usually in the center of a building and extending upwards to the roof.

A_R,ARR.    	Arrival (arr.) times
YSE_,"YSER.    	The Yser originates in northern France and flows through Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser is often associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war, the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."

TA_,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious, involving lots of tapping on the spacebar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to 'jump' across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key which could be depressed, causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."
E_RL,"EARL.    	The Wars of the Roses was a series of civil wars fought for the throne of England between the rival Houses of Lancaster and York. Ultimately the Lancastrians emerged victorious after Henry Tudor defeated King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field.

Henry had a relatively long reign of 23 years that lasted until his death, after which his son succeeded to the throne as Henry VIII, continuing the relatively short-lived Tudor dynasty. He ruled from 1509 until his death in 1547. Henry VIII was the last male to lead the the House of Tudor, as his daughter Queen Elizabeth I died without issue."

NEM_,"NEMO.    	In the 1954 movie version of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", Captain Nemo goes down with his ship. In the novel by Jules Verne, the fate of Nemo and his crew isn't quite so cut and dry, although the assumption is perhaps that they did indeed head for Davy Jones's Locker."

M_SA,"MESA.    	""Mesa"" is the Spanish for ""table"" and is of course is how we get the term ""mesa"" that describes a geographic feature. ""What's the difference between a butte and a mesa?"" I hear you cry! Both are hills with flat tops, but a mesa has a top that is wider than it is tall. A butte is a much narrower formation, taller than it is wide."

AS_ER,"ASNER.    	Ed Asner is most famous for playing the irascible but lovable Lou Grant on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and on the spin-off drama ""Lou Grant"". Off-screen Asner is noted for his political activism. He served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild, and was very involved in the 1980 SAG strike. When ""Lou Grant"" was cancelled in in 1982, despite decent ratings, there was a lot of talk that the cancellation was a move by the network against Asner personally. In fact, one of Asner's activist colleagues, Howard Hesseman (who played Johnny Fever) found that his show ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" was also cancelled ... on the very same day."

This was more precisely defined as a strip of land 'one furrow long' (i.e. one furlong) and one furlong wide. The length of one furlong was equal to 10 chains, or 40 rods. A area of one furlong times 10 rods was one rood."

N_EL,"NOEL.    	'Noël' is the French word for the Christmas season, ultimately coming from the Latin word for ""birth"" (natalis). Noel has come to be used as an alternative name for a Christmas carol."
_RLE,"ERLE.    	I must have read all of the Perry Mason books when I was in college. I think they kept me sane when I was facing the pressure of exams. Author Erle Stanley Gardner was himself a lawyer, although he didn't get into the profession the easy way. Gardner went to law school, but got himself suspended after a month. So, he became a self-taught attorney and opened his own law office in Merced, California. Understandably, he gave up the law once his novels became successful."
_ON,"RON.    	Ron Reagan's views couldn't be any further from his father's, I think. Before Air America went bust, he had a daily 3-hour spot, and these days he makes frequent appearances on MSNBC. Reagan is also a good dancer, and for a while was a member of the Joffrey Ballet."
_OEL,"NOEL.    	'Noël' is the French word for the Christmas season, ultimately coming from the Latin word for ""birth"" (natalis). Noel has come to be used as an alternative name for a Christmas carol."

EYR_,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is of course the novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."
I_OR,"IGOR.    	Igor Sikorsky was a Russian pioneer in the world of aviation. He designed and indeed piloted the world's first multi-engine, fixed-wing aircraft in 1913.

ET_S,"ETAS.    	Los Angeles International Airport is the sixth busiest airport in the world in terms of passenger traffic, and the busiest here on the West Coast of the US. The airport was opened in 1930 as Mines Field and was renamed to Los Angeles Airport in 1941. On the airport property is the iconic white structure that resembles a flying saucer. This is called the Theme Building and I believe it is mainly used as a restaurant and observation deck for the public. The airport used to be identified by the letters 'LA', but when the aviation industry went to a three-letter standard for airport identification, this was changed to 'LAX'. Apparently the 'X' has no significant meaning."

_TO,"ITO.    	In the 1880s, Japanese leaders were concerned that their system of government was not defined well enough, leading to ambiguity about areas of responsibility and authority. One of the leaders at the time was Ito Hirobumi, and he took himself and his staff over to Europe to examine the systems of government across that continent, especially those of the British and German Empires. On returning to Japan he lobbied for and was successful in the adoption of a constitution for Japan and a modern system of government. Ito became the country's first Prime Minister in 1885."

When Ho was touring with his two backing singers, Patti Swallie and Elizabeth Guevara, all three of them shared a room together.

The arrangement was quite open, it seems, with all ten kids visiting each other regularly. To each his own ..."

M_E,"MOE.    	If you've seen a few of the films starring ""The Three Stooges"" you'll have noticed that the line up changed over the years. The original trio was made up of Moe and Shemp Howard (two brothers) and Larry Fine (a good friend of the Howards). This line up was usually known as ""Moe, Larry and Shemp"". Then Curly Howard replaced his brother when Shemp quit the act, creating the most famous trio, ""Moe, Larry And Curly"". Shemp returned when Curly had a debilitating stroke in 1946, and Shemp stayed with the troupe until he died in 1955. Shemp was replaced by Joe Besser, and then ""Curly-Joe"" DeRita.

UT_H,"UTAH.    	When Mormon pioneers were settling what is today the state of Utah, they referred to the area as Deseret, a word that means 'beehive' according to the Book of Mormon. Today Utah is known as the Beehive State and there is a beehive symbol on the Utah state flag."

While travelling, Guevara was moved by the plight of the people he saw and their working conditions and what he viewed as capitalistic exploitation. In Mexico City he met brothers Raul and Fidel Castro and was persuaded to join their cause, the overthrow of the US-backed government in Cuba. He rose to second-in-command among the Cuban insurgents, and when Castro came to power Guevara was influential in repelling the Bay of Pigs Invasion and bringing Soviet nuclear missiles to the island. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to continue his work as a revolutionary. He was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967, and was executed.

ETE_,"ETES.    	""Vous êtes"" is the French for ""you are""."
YS_R,"YSER.    	The Yser originates in northern France and flows through Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser is often associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war, the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."
OMAH_,"OMAHA.    	Omaha is the largest city in the state of Nebraska. It is located on the Missouri River, about 10 miles north of the mouth of the Platte River When Nebraska was still a territory Omaha was its capital, but when Nebraska achieved statehood the capital was moved to the city of Lincoln."

OPE_,"OPEC.    	The OPEC cartel (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) was formally established in 1960 and has been headquartered in Vienna since 1965. The US is actually the third largest oil producer in the world (after Russia and Saudi Arabia). One reason America isn't in OPEC, even though we are a big producer, is that we import a lot more than we export. But we all probably knew that already ..."
B_A,"BRA.    	The word ""brassière"" is of course French in origin, but it isn't the word the French use for a ""bra"". In France what we call a bra is known as a ""soutien-gorge"", translating to ""held under the neck"". The word ""brassière"" is indeed used in France but there it describes a baby's undershirt, a lifebelt or a harness. ""Brassière"" comes from the Old French word for an ""arm protector"" in a military uniform (""bras"" is the French for ""arm""). Later ""brassière"" came to mean ""breastplate"" and from there the word was used for a type of woman's corset. The word jumped into English around 1900."

A_S,"ASS.    	A ""bozo"" is a man with a low IQ, and one who is usually quite muscular. We've been using the word since the early 1900s and it possibly comes from the Spanish ""bozal"" that was used to describe someone who speaks Spanish poorly."
E_RL,"EARL.    	In the ranking of nobles, an earl comes above a viscount and below a marquess. The rank of earl is used in the British peerage system and is equivalent to the rank of count in other countries. Other British ranks have female forms (e.g. marquess and marchioness, viscount and viscountess), but there isn't a female word for the rank of earl. A female given the same rank as an earl is known as a countess."

_AT,"TAT.    	The word ""tattoo"" was first used in English in the writings of the famous English explorer Captain Cook. In his descriptions of the indelible marks adorning the skin of Polynesian natives, Cook anglicized the Tahitian word ""tatau"" into our ""tattoo""."
NOE_,"NOEL.    	'Noël' is the French word for the Christmas season, ultimately coming from the Latin word for ""birth"" (natalis). Noel has come to be used as an alternative name for a Christmas carol."
LE_,"LEN.    	I used to walk my dog right past author Len Deighton's house years ago, as we lived in the same village in Ireland (probably my only claim to fame!). Deighton wrote the excellent espionage thriller ""The IPCRESS File"", made into a 1965 movie starring Michael Caine."
_TRIA,ATRIA.    	In modern architecture an atrium (plural 'atria' or 'atriums') is a large open space usually in the center of a building and extending upwards to the roof. The original atrium was an open court in the center of an Ancient Roman house. One could access most of the enclosed rooms of the house from the atrium.
A_R,APR.    	The phenomenon of 'April Showers' really applies to the UK and Ireland. Increased occurrence of rain during April is largely due to an annual change in the position of the jet stream.
TA_,"TAB.    	The oldest method of opening a can with a device included in the can's design is the pull-tab or ring pull, invented in Canada in 1956. The design was long-lived but it had its problems, so the world heaved a sigh of relief with the invention of the stay-on-tab in 1975. The new design led to less injuries and eliminated all those used pull-tabs that littered the streets."
_LR,"SLR.    	SLR stands for ""single lens reflex"". Usually cameras with changeable lenses are the SLR type. The main feature of an SLR is that a mirror reflects the image seen through the lens out through the viewfinder, so that the photographer sees exactly what the lens sees. The mirror moves out of the way as the picture is taken, and the image that comes through the lens falls onto unexposed film, or nowadays onto a digital sensor."
ER_E,"ERSE.    	There are actually three Erse languages: Irish, Manx (spoken on the Isle of Man) and Scots Gaelic. In their own tongues, these would be Gaeilge (in Ireland), Gaelg (on the Isle of Man) and Gaidhlig (in Scotland)."
E_LE,"ERLE.    	I must have read all of the Perry Mason books when I was in college. I think they kept me sane when I was facing the pressure of exams. Author Erle Stanley Gardner was himself a lawyer, although he didn't get into the profession the easy way. Gardner went to law school, but got himself suspended after a month. So, he became a self-taught attorney and opened his own law office in Merced, California. Understandably, he gave up the law once his novels became successful."
M_E,"MOE.    	If you've seen a few of the films starring ""The Three Stooges"" you'll have noticed that the line up changed over the years. The original trio was made up of Moe and Shemp Howard (two brothers), and Larry Fine (a good friend of the Howards). This line up was usually known as ""Moe, Larry and Shemp"". Then Curly Howard replaced his brother when Shemp quit the act, creating the most famous trio, ""Moe, Larry And Curly"". Shemp returned when Curly had a debilitating stroke in 1946, and he stayed with the troupe until he died in 1955. Shemp was replaced by Joe Besser, and then ""Curly-Joe"" DeRita. When Larry had a stroke in 1970, it effectively marked the end of the act."
A_E,"APE.    	""The Hairy Ape"" is a play by Eugene O'Neill, and tells of a laborer on an ocean liner who leaves the ship and tries to make his way in Manhattan. He finds it hard to fit in, and finds most empathy with a gorilla in the zoo who he regards as a kindred spirit. At the end of the play, the hero dies in the arms of the gorilla."

N_MO,"NEMO.    	In the 1954 movie version of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", Captain Nemo goes down with his ship. In the novel by Jules Verne the fate of Nemo and his crew isn't quite so cut and dry, although the inference is perhaps that they did indeed head for Davy Jones' Locker."
H_R,"HER.    	The ship prefix 'HMS' is used by the warships of the Royal Navy, and stands for 'Her/His Majesty's Ship/Submarine'. The prefix 'RMS' is used by ships of the merchant navy, and stands for 'Royal Mail Ship/Steamer'."
I_O,"ITO.    	In the 1880s, Japanese leaders were concerned that their system of government was not defined well enough, leading to ambiguity about areas of responsibility and authority. One of the leaders at the time was Ito Hirobumi, and he took himself and his staff over to Europe to examine the systems of government across that continent, especially those of the British and German Empires. On returning to Japan he lobbied for and was successful in the adoption of a constitution for the country and a modern system of government. Ito became the country's first Prime Minister in 1885."
TA_,"TAI.    	More correctly called tai chi chuan, tai chi is a martial art that is mostly practiced to improve overall health and increase longevity."

_BA,"MBA.    	The business school at Northwestern University is called the John L. Kellogg School of Management. John L. Kellogg was the son of Will Keith Kellogg of breakfast cereal fame, and John's foundation made a generous donation in 1979, hence the current name for the business school."
NE_O,"NEMO.    	In the 1954 movie version of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", Captain Nemo goes down with his ship. In the novel by Jules Verne the fate of Nemo and his crew isn't quite so cut and dry, although the inference is perhaps that they did indeed head for Davy Jones' Locker."
IGO_,"IGOR.    	Igor has been the assistant to Dracula, Frankenstein and Young Frankenstein, among others. He is almost invariably portrayed as a hunchback."
_IA,"MIA.    	Mia Farrow is an energetic, award-winning actress who really hasn't looked back in her career since her first leading role, in ""Rosemary's Baby"" back in 1968. Her on-screen celebrity is matched by the interest created by her personal life. Her first husband was Frank Sinatra, a wedding in 1966 that received a lot of attention partly due to the couple's age difference (she was 21, he was 50). Her second husband was almost as famous, the magnificent musician André Previn. Farrow then moved in with Woody Allen, a relationship that famously fell apart when Farrow discovered that Allen was having a sexual relationship with Soon-Yi, one of her adopted daughters from the marriage with André Previn."
_PE,"APE.    	King Kong' really is a classic movie. It stars Fay Wray as the young woman (Ann Darrow) with whom Kong falls in love. Wray was very interested in the role as she was told that she would be playing opposite the ""tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood"". She thought it might be Clark Gable. At least that's how the story goes ..."
_RA,"BRA.    	Tank top' is another one of those terms that always catches me out, as it has a different meaning on each side of the Atlantic. In the US a tank top is a sleeveless shirt, something we would call a 'vest' back in Ireland (and the US 'vest' is what we call a 'waist coat'). A tank top in Ireland is a sleeveless sweater, which further adds to the confusion. The name 'tank top' is derived from 'tank suit', an old name for a woman's one-piece bathing suit. The use of 'tank' for the bathing suit came from 'swimming tank', an obsolete term used in the 1920s for a swimming pool."
I_I,"ICI.    	The name ""Quebec"" comes from an Algonquin word ""kebec"" meaning ""where the river narrows"". This refers to the area around Quebec City where the St. Lawrence River narrows as it flows through a gap lined by steep cliffs."
NI_,"NIA.    	Not only is the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", she also wrote the screenplay. The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history that didn't make it to number one. That record I think reflects the fact that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came when a spin-off TV show was launched called ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It ran for only 7 episodes."
U_E,UKE.    	The ukulele ('uke') originated in the 1800s and mimicked a small guitar brought to the Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants.

During the Boer War (1899-1902), Locomobile produced the first car ever designed for use in a war, a generator and searchlight tractor made for the British Army. Production was switched to internal combustion-powered vehicles in 1903, and the company focused on luxury vehicles until it went out of business in 1929."
EE_,EEO.    	Equal Opportunity Employment is a term that has been around since 1964 when the Equal Employment Commission was set up by the Civil Rights Act.
_AB,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious, involving lots of tapping on the space bar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to ""jump"" across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key which could be depressed, causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."
TBA_,"T-BAR.    	A T-bar is a type of ski lift in which the skiers are pulled up the hill in pairs, with each pair standing (not sitting!) either side of T-shaped metal bar.

OPE_,"OPEC.    	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was founded in 1960 at a conference held in Baghdad, Iraq that was attended by Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Nine more countries joined the alliance soon after, and OPEC set up headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland and then Vienna, Austria in 1965. The basic aim of OPEC was to wrench control of oil prices from the oil companies and to put it in the hands of the sovereign states that own the natural resource."
AP_,"APR.    	The exact etymology of 'April', the fourth month of our year, seems to be uncertain. The ancient Romans called it 'mensis Aprilis', which roughly translated as 'opening month. The suggestion is that April is the month in which fruits, flowers and animals 'open' their life cycles."
NO_L,"NOEL.    	'Noël' is the French word for the Christmas season, ultimately coming from the Latin word for 'birth' (natalis). Noel has come to be used as an alternative name for a Christmas carol."

_AR,"EAR.    	Darwin's tubercle is a condition found in the ear of just over 10% of the population. The condition is congenital and presents itself as a thickening of the outer rim of the outer ear. The condition's name is in honor of the fact that Charles Darwin first described it, although Darwin himself called the condition 'Woolnerian tip'. thomas Woolner was a British sculptor who routinely included the condition in his human sculptures."

A_ME,"ACME.    	The Acme Corporation is a fictional company used mainly by Looney Tunes, and within the Looney Tunes empire it was used mainly in the Road Runner cartoons. Wile E.

I_OR,"IGOR.    	'Prince Igor' is an opera by the Russian composer, Alexander Borodin. Borodin died before he had finished 'Prince Igor', so it was completed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov.
