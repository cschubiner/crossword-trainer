The winds arise from a buildup of air pressure in the Great Basin that lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Under the right conditions, that air spills over the peaks of the Sierra Nevada and basically ""falls"" down the side of the Sierra range, heading for the ocean.

I have spent many a fine day traipsing around Ireland learning about his life, but I have yet to appreciate one of his books. To me, his life is more absorbing than his writing. Having said that, ""Ulysses"" is an interesting novel in that it chronicles just one ordinary day in the life of a Dubliner named Leopold Bloom. There's a huge celebration of ""Ulysses"" in Dublin every year on June 16th, called Bloomsday. The festivities vary from readings and performances of the storyline, to good old pub crawls. 'Ulysses' was made into a film of the same name in 1967 starring Milo O'Shea. Back in 1921 however, the book was effectively banned in the US after a New YOrk court declared the magazine in which was serialized was declared obscene.

The last time it rained in Aswan (apparently the latest info, as early April 2010) was a thunderstorm on May 13, 2006. The nearby Aswan Dam is very famous, and is actually two dams. The Low Dam was first built in 1902 (and modified later). The High Dam was completed in 1970."
KT_,KTS.    	Knights (kts.) are the only pieces on a chessboard that can jump over other pieces. 
TET_N,"TETON.    	Grand Teton National Park is located just south of Yellowstone NP, and a must-see if you are visiting the latter. The park is named after the tallest peak in the magnificent Teton Range known as Grand Teton. The origins of the name 'Teton' is not very clear, although my one story is that it was named by French trappers, as the word 'tetons' in French is a slang term meaning 'breasts'."
_LEE,"E LEE.    	Robert E. Lee is of course renowned as a southern officer in the Civil War. He was a somewhat reluctant participant in the war in that Lee opposed the secession of his home state of Virginia from the Union. At the beginning of the war, President Lincoln invited Lee to take command of the whole Union Army but Lee declined, choosing instead to stay loyal to his home state."
_SSA,"OSSA.    	Mount Ossa in Greece is located between Mt. Pelion in the south, and the famed Mt. Olympus in the north. Mount Ossa is also known as Kissavos."
_MORE,"S'MORE.    	S'mores are a treat peculiar to North America, usually eaten around a campfire. A s'more consists of a roasted marshmallow and a layer of chocolate sandwiched between two graham crackers. The earliest written reference to the recipe is in a 1927 publication called ""Tramping and Trailing with the Girl Scouts"". Girl Scouts always did corner the market on cookies and the like!"
_IU,"LIU.    	Lucy Liu is an actress from Queens, New York. Liu's big break came when she was chosen to play the Ling Woo character in ""Ally McBeal"". I liked her in the 2000 film ""Charlie's Angels"" but as I am no fan of Quentin Tarantino, I did not enjoy the movie ""Kill Bill"". I am having fun watching one of Liu's more recent projects, in which she plays Jane Watson, one of the two lead characters in the TV crime drama 'Elementary'."
_IT,"NIT.    	The word ""carp"" used to mean simply ""talk"" back in the 13th century, with its roots in the Old Norwegian ""karpa"" meaning ""to brag"". A century later the Latin word ""carpere"" meaning ""to slander"" influenced the use of ""carp"" so that it came to mean ""find fault with""."
I_K,"INK.    	The key features of a laser printer (or copier) are that it uses plain paper and produces quality text at high speed. Laser printers work by projecting a laser image of the printed page onto a rotating drum that is coated with photoconductors (material that becomes conductive when exposed to light). The areas of the drum exposed to the laser carry a different charge than the unexposed areas. Dry ink (called toner) sticks to the unexposed areas due to electrostatic charge. The toner is then transferred to paper by contact and is fused into the paper by the application of heat. So, that explains why paper coming out of a laser printer is warm, and sometimes powdery ..."
Z_TI,"ZITI.    	Cylindrical pasta is known in general as 'penne', and there are many variants. Ziti is a particularly large and long tube, with square-cut ends."
_EPP,"DEPP.    	Ed Wood was a screenwriter, director, producer and actor who made a lot of low-budget films during the 1950s. Wood worked a lot with the actor Bela Lugosi and when Lugosi passed away, the popularity of Wood's film died off with his star. Tim Burton made a biopic about the life and career of Ed Wood that was released in 1994, a movie that was simply called 'Ed Wood'."
LEN_O,LENTO.    	A lento passage is a piece of music that has a slow tempo.
KT_,"KTS.    	It is believed that the game of chess originated in northwest India, evolving from a 6th-century game called ""caturanga"", a Sanskrit word meaning ""four divisions"". These four (military) divisions were represented in the game:"
_LIO,"CLIO.    	'The Art of Painting' is one of the few works left to us by the great Dutch painter, Johannes Vermeer. The work depicts an artist sitting at a canvas, with a young lady as his subject. 'The Art of Painting' was 'purchased' by Adolf Hitler in 1940 from its Austrian owner, not long after the invasion of Austria. After WWII, US forces discovered the painting and presented it to the Austrian government. Today it is on display in Vienna."
_ION,"LION.    	I've always liked the song 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', a 1961 hit for the Tokens. The song has a long history. It was written and recorded originally in 1939 by Solomon Linda under the title 'Mbube', Zulu for 'lion'. It was released again in 1951 by a band called the Weavers under the title 'Wimoweh', the word sung in the chorus. However, ""wimoweh"" was a mishearing of the song's original chorus 'uyimbube', Zulu for 'you're a lion'. Then along came the Tokens in 1961 and recorded it as 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'. Quite interesting ..."
OPIAT_,"OPIATE.    	Opiates are the narcotic alkaloids found in the opium poppy plant, although some synthetic versions and derivatives of the same alkaloids are also called opiates. To produce opiates, the latex sap of the opium poppy is collected and processed. The naturally-occurring drugs of morphine and codeine can both be extracted from the sap. Some synthesis is required to make derivative drugs like heroin and oxycodone."
S_KE,"SAKE.    	We refer to the Japanese alcoholic beverage made from rice as 'sake'. We've gotten things a bit mixed up in the West. 'Sake' is actually the word that the Japanese use for all alcoholic drinks. What we know as sake, we sometimes refer to as rice wine. Also, the starch in the rice is first converted to sugars that are then fermented into alcohol. This is more akin to a beer-brewing process than wine production, so the end product is really a rice 'beer' rather than a rice 'wine'."
AB_A,"ABRA.    	Abra Bacon is a character in John Steinbeck's novel, 'East of Eden'."
K_N,"KAN.    	The National Teachers Hall of Fame was founded in 1989 in Emporia, Kansas to recognize the most outstanding educators in the nation. Five teachers have been inducted into the Hall of Fame in June every year since 1992."
OIL_R,"OILER.    	The National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers are so called because they are located in Alberta, Canada ... oil country."
TERR_,"TERRA.    	The name ""terra cotta"" comes to us from Latin via Italian and means ""baked earth"". It is a ceramic made from clay, which is left unglazed. Maybe the most famous work in terra cotta is the Terracotta Army, the enormous collection of life-size figures that were buried with the Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of China around 210 BC. I had the privilege of seeing some of this collection when it toured the US a few years ago, and just the few pieces on display were so very impressive."
ME_AL,METAL.    	'To found' is to melt metal and pour it into a mold in order to make molded metal objects.
ROE_,"ROEG.    	Nicolas Roeg is film director from England with quite the pedigree when it comes to association with great movies. He contributed to 1962's 'Lawrence of Arabia', and he himself directed noted films like 'Walkabout' (1972), 'Don't Look Now' (1973) and 'The Man Who Fell to Earth' (1976)."
PE_S,"PEAS.    	Pasta primavera is one of my favorite Italian dishes. It is made of pasta with firm fresh vegetables. Although the origin of the dish is disputed, it almost certainly was created on this side of the Atlantic. 'Primavera' is Italian (and Spanish) for the season of spring."
MO_H,"MOTH.    	Back in 1947, the famed computer programmer Grace Hopper noticed some colleagues fixing a piece of equipment by removing a dead moth from a relay. She remarked that they were 'debugging' the system, and so Hopper has been given credit for popularizing the term."
DRAN_,"DRANO.    	To clean out drains we might buy Crystal Drano which is sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely-divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that that mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."
O_IGAMI,ORIGAMI.    	Origami is the traditional Japanese art form of paper folding. The best-known example of the craft is the paper crane. The word 'origami' is derived from 'ori' (folding) and 'kami' (paper).
CNB_,"CNBC.    	CNBC is a business news channel owned by NBC. Launched in 1989, up until 1991 CNBC was known as the Consumer News and Business Channel."
SU_DE,"SUEDE.    	Suede is leather made from the underside of the skin, mainly from a lamb. As such it is very soft, although not as durable as leather made from the exterior skin. The soft leather was, and is still used for making gloves. Back in 1859 these gloves were called ""gants de Suede"" in France, or ""gloves of Sweden"". So, ""suede"" is simply the French word for Sweden."
K_EE,KNEE.    	The patella is the kneecap.
A_G,"ALG.    	Algebra is a branch of mathematics in which arithmetical operations are performed on variables rather than specific numbers (x,y etc). The term 'algebra' comes from the Arabic 'al jebr' meaning 'reunion of broken parts'."
T_RAH,"TORAH.    	A Torah scroll (also 'Sefer Torah') is a handwritten copy of the Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Scriptures."
I_MS,"IAMS.    	Iams dog food was produced by the animal nutritionist Paul Iams. He felt that household pets were suffering somewhat by being fed a diet of table scraps, so he developed a dry dog food that he felt was more nutritious and suitable for pet dogs. He founded the Iams company, now part of Procter & Gamble, in 1946."
E_G,"EKG.    	An EKG measures electrical activity in the heart. Back in my homeland of Ireland, an EKG is known as an ECG (for electrocardiogram). We use the German name in the US, Elektrokardiogramm, giving us EKG. Apparently the abbreviation EKG is preferred as ECG might be confused (if poorly handwritten, I guess) with EEG, the abbreviation for an electroencephalogram."
S_RENA,SERENA.    	The 2014 film 'Serena' stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence as a newlywed couple struggling to maintain their timber company in North Carolina in the thirties. The movie is based on a 2008 novel of the same name by Ron Rash.
_OOH,"POOH.    	Alan Alexander (A.A.) Milne was an English author, best known for his delightful ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" series of books. He had only one son, Christopher Robin Milne, born in 1920. The young Milne was the inspiration for the Christopher Robin character in the Winnie-the-Pooh stories. Winnie-the-Pooh was named after Christopher Robin's real teddy bear, one he called Winnie, who in turn was named after a Canadian black bear called Winnie that the Milnes would visit in London Zoo. The original Winnie teddy bear is on display at the main branch of the New York Public Library in New York."
MI_NE,"MILNE.    	A. A. Milne's 'Winnie-the-Pooh' has been translated into many languages, and is one of the few modern titles for which there is a Latin version. Alexander Lenard had 'Winnie ille Pu' published in 1958, and two years later it made it to the New York Times Best Seller List, the only book in the Latin language ever to get that honor."
GE_DE,GEODE.    	A geode is a rock in which there is a cavity lined or filled with crystal formations.
BEA_,"BEAU.    	""Beau"" is the French word for ""beautiful"", in the male sense."
_ETA,"META.    	In recent decades the prefix 'meta-' has started to be used as a standalone adjective. In this sense 'meta' means 'self-referential', describing something that refers to itself. For example, 'This sentence starts with the word 'this' and ends with the word 'this'' might be called a meta sentence. A movie that is about the making of a movie could also be described as meta. For example, 'The Blair Witch Project' might be described as meta, which is a movie about some young people making a scary movie about the Blair Witch."
ANA_,"ANAS.    	The Santa Ana winds are the very dry air currents that sweep offshore late in the year in Southern California. Because these air currents are so dry, they are noted for their influence over forest fires in the area, especially in the heat of the fall. The winds arise from a buildup of air pressure in the Great Basin that lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Under the right conditions, that air spills over the peaks of the Sierra Nevada and basically ""falls"" down the side of the Sierra range, heading for the ocean. As the air falls it becomes drier and heats up so that relative humidity can fall to below 10% by the time it hits the coast."
S_EREO,"STEREO.    	Monophonic sound (""mono"") is sound reproduced using just one audio channel, which is usually played out of just one speaker. Stereophonic sound is reproduced using two audio channels, with the sound from each channel played out of two different speakers. The pair of stereo speakers are usually positioned apart from each other so that sound appears to come from between the two. Quadraphonic sound (4.0 surround sound) uses four audio channels with the sound played back through four speakers often positioned at the corners of the room in which one is listening."
_CS,ACS.    	Room coolers are air conditioning units (ACs).
D_DO,"DODO.    	A dodo is a foolish person, and dodo is word that comes into English from the Portuguese ""doudo"". ""Doudo"" was a slang term used by Portuguese sailors for the extinct bird that we now know as the dodo."
B_SE,"BASE.    	As we all recall from chemistry class, a pH of 7 is considered neutral. Anything less than 7 is an acid, and anything above 7 is a base."
_ANS,"HANS.    	'The Katzenjammer Kids' is a comic strip that debuted in 1897, and is still syndicated. That makes it the longest-running comic strip still in syndication."
SU_DE,"SUEDE.    	Suede is leather made from the underside of the skin, mainly from a lamb. As such it is very soft, although not as durable as leather made from the exterior skin. The soft leather was, and is still used for making gloves. Back in 1859 these gloves were called ""gants de Suede"" in France, or ""gloves of Sweden"". So, the name ""suede"" comes from the French word for Sweden."
S_P,"SEP.    	The month of September is the ninth month in our year, although the name 'September' comes from the Latin word 'septum' meaning 'seventh'. September was the seventh month in the Roman calendar until the year 46 BC when Julius Caesar introduced the Julian calendar. The Julian system moved the start of the year from March 1st to January 1st, and shifted September to the ninth month. The Gregorian calendar that we use today was introduced in 1582."
E_G,"EKG.    	An EKG measures electrical activity in the heart. Back in my homeland of Ireland, an EKG is known as an ECG (for 'electrocardiogram'). We use the German name in the US, Elektrokardiogramm, giving us EKG. Apparently the abbreviation EKG is preferred as ECG might be confused (if poorly handwritten, I guess) with EEG, the abbreviation for an electroencephalogram."
NI_RO,"NITRO.    	Laughing gas is the common name for nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is used as an anesthetic, particularly by dentists. It is also used in motor racing to increase the power output of engines. Laughing gas was first synthesized by the English chemist Joseph Priestly, but it was Humphrey Davy who discovered its potential as an anesthetic. Once it was realized that the gas could give the patient a fit of the giggles, ""laughing gas parties"" became common among those could afford them."
