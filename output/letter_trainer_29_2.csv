After retiring from the game, his career continued to flourish. He worked as a sports broadcaster for many years, and then landed a major role on television's ""Little House on the Prairie"", playing Jonathan Garvey. In one episode, Garvey was to help coach a boy's football team, so the writers gave Olsen's character the tongue-in-cheek line ""I don't know nothin' about football!""

In essence, the World Wide Web is a vast collection of documents that is accessible using the Internet, with each document containing hyperlinks which point to other documents in the collection. So the 'Web' is different from the Internet, although the terms are often used interchangeably. The Web is the collection of documents, and the Internet is the global network of computers on which the documents reside."
_POOF,"SPOOF.    	'Scary Movie' is one of those parody movies, a film released in 2000 that pokes fun at famous horror films. It was advertised with the tagline 'No mercy. No shame. No sequel'. The 'no sequel' reference was a parody in itself, making fun of the fact that slasher movies in particular were made into strings of sequels. But there was in fact to be a sequel to 'Scary Movie', in fact three of them with one more on the way. 'Scary Movie 2' came out in 2001, with the tagline 'We lied'."

The band was the idea of guitarist and harmonica player Brian Jones, and it was he who invited Richards and Jagger to join, as well as Ian Stewart, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts to make an original lineup of six band members. Jones called the band ""Rollin' Stone"" back then in 1962, named for the song by Muddy Waters. Jones was the leader, manager and decision maker for the first few years until songs written by Richards and Jagger became hits and he started to lose artistic control. In 1967, Jones was arrested for drug possession, and again in 1968. When his trouble with the law prevented him from getting a US work visa, Jones wasn't able to accompany the Stones on a 1969 US tour. That was the last straw, it seems, and Jones and the Stones parted company. Famously, one month later, Jones was found dead, at the bottom of his swimming pool."
_DAGES,"ADAGES.    	Cliché' is a word that comes from the world of printing. In the days when type was added as individual letters into a printing plate, for efficiency some oft-used phrases and words were created as one single slug of metal. The word 'cliché' was used for such a grouping of letters. It's easy to see how the same word would become a term to describe any overused phrase. Supposedly, 'cliché' comes from French, from the verb 'clicher' meaning 'to click'. The idea is that when a matrix of letters was dropped in molten metal to make a cliché, it made a clicking sound."

There have been many (terrible) ""sequels"" written for ""Pride and Prejudice"", but I have read one ""spin off"" that I heartily recommend if you'd like to explore the story of Elizabeth and Darcy some more. There is a three-part novel called ""Fitzwilliam Darcy: Gentleman"" written by Pamela Aidan and published in 2003-2005. Ms. Aiden does a great job retelling the story of ""Pride and Prejudice"", but from Darcy's perspective. It really is a great read, even for die-hard Austen fans ..."
ELL_,ELLY.    	Elly May Clampett was played by Donna Douglas on the sixties television show 'The Beverly Hillbillies'. Douglas is best known on the big screen for playing the lead opposite Elvis Presley in 1966's 'Frankie and Johnny'.
TABO_S,"TABOOS.    	Iconoclasm is the deliberate destruction of society's icons, either religious or cultural.

As such, the term ""iconoclast"" has come to have a broader meaning, describing anyone who stands up against established convention."
Y_RTLE,"YERTLE.    	""Yertle the Turtle"" is a story by Dr. Seuss. The book is noted for the inclusion of the word ""burp"", which back in 1958 when it was published, was considered to be vulgar. But no one seemed to mind!"

Back then, individuals were labelled as Type A in order to emphasize a perceived increased risk of heart disease.

ABB_,"ABBE.    	Franz Liszt was a composer and pianist from Hungary active in the 1800s. As a pianist, Liszt was a true virtuoso, and was regarded by most in his day as the greatest player of all time. In 1859, Liszt's 20-year old son died, and then three years later his daughter passed away. These events led to him taking up residence in a monastery outside room. He was ordained in 1865, after which he was often referred to as Abbé Liszt."
DELTA_,DELTAS.    	Delta is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. We are most familiar with an upper-case delta and its distinctive triangular shape.

ICEA_E,"ICE AGE.    	Ice ages are periods in the Earth's history when there are extensive ice sheets present in the northern and southern hemispheres.

FOR_ ,"FORE!.    	No one seems to know for sure where the golfing term ""fore!"" comes from. It has been used at least as far back as 1881, and since then has been called out to warn other golfers that a wayward ball might be heading their way. My favorite possibility for its origin is that it is a contraction of the Gaelic warning cry ""Faugh a Ballagh!"" (clear the way!) which is still called out in the sport of road bowling. Road bowling is an Irish game where players bowl balls along roads between villages, trying to reach the end of the course in as few bowls as possible, just like in golf!"
AVOCE_,"AVOCET.    	The avocet is found in warm climates, usually in saline wetlands where it uses its upcurved bill to sweep from side-to-side in water searching for aquatic insects on which it feeds.

_TRO,STRO.    	The Houston baseball team changed its name to the Astros from the Colt .45s in 1965 when they started playing in the Astrodome. The Astrodome was so called in recognition of the city's long association with the US space program.

I_RE,"IMRE.    	Imre Nagy was twice Prime Minister of Hungary. He was ahead of his time, I think. His second term as Prime Minister came during the Hungarian Uprising against the Soviet Union in October 1956. The Soviet's invaded of course, and arrested Nagy. He was tried in secret, sentenced to death and hanged."
OZA_KS,"OZARKS.    	The Ozark Mountains aren't really mountains geographically speaking, and the Ozarks are better described by the alternate name, the Ozark Plateau. It's not really certain how the Ozarks got their name, but my favorite theory is that ""Ozarks"" is the phonetic spelling of ""aux Arks"", short for ""of Arkansas"" in French."

CAREE_S,"CAREENS.    	""Careen"" dates back to 1590 when it meant ""to turn a ship on its side, exposing the keel"". The word evolved from the Middle French word ""carene"" meaning ""keel"". Our modern usage, meaning to lean or tilt, only dates back as far as the 1880s. Careen should not be confused with ""career"", a verb meaning to move rapidly. One has to ""career"" from side-to -side in order to ""careen""."
CAT_UP,"CATSUP.    	'Catsup' is an American spelling of 'ketchup' that is sometimes used, especially in the south of the country."

HIK_,"HIKE.    	We never used the word ""gridiron"" when I was growing up in Ireland (meaning a grill used for cooking food over an open fire).

DELI_AH,"DELILAH.    	Delilah is a Biblical figure, the wife of Samson. Delilah was engaged by the Philistines to betray her husband by determining the secret of his great strength. Samson lied to his wife three times, but on the fourth asking he told his wife the truth, that he did not cut his hair. Delilah then convinced Samson to shear his locks and so allowed him to be captured by his enemies. Over the centuries, it has been usual to depict Delilah actually cutting off her husband's hair, but the Bible actually says that she persuaded Samson to do the job himself."
I_IGO,"INIGO.    	Inigo Jones was a British architect, a native of London. The most famous Jones's design is probably London's Covent Garden Square."
M_NS,"MEN'S.    	The YMCA is a worldwide movement that has its roots in London, England. There, in 1844, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) was founded with the intent of promoting Christian principles through the development of ""a healthy spirit, mind and body"". The founder, George Williams, saw the need to create YMCA facilities for young men who were flocking to the cities as the Industrial Revolution flourished. He saw that these men were frequenting taverns and brothels, and wanted to offer a more wholesome alternative."
GREE_,"GREER.    	Germaine Greer is a very outspoken Australian feminist who was catapulted into the limelight with her runaway bestseller ""The Female Eunuch"", first published in 1970. Greer has lived in the UK for many years, and I see her a lot on British television news/panel shows.

The post-revolution government sought the extradition of the Shah back to Iran while he was in the United States seeking medical care (he had cancer).

Some say that this resentment precipitated the storming of the US Embassy in Tehran and the resulting hostage crisis."

The following year he started hosting ""The Arsenio Hall Show"", which ran until 1994. He had a loyal group of fans that had the habit of almost ""barking"" while pumping their fists in the air. The move became so popular it extended far beyond the influences of Arsenio, and to this day can be seen performed as a mark of appreciation. Not by me, mind you ..."
REDC_OSS,"RED CROSS.    	Back in 1859, a Swiss businessman called Henri Dunant went to meet French emperor Napoleon III, to discuss making it easier to conduct commerce in French-occupied Algeria. The Emperor was billeted at Solferino, where France and Austria were engaged in a major battle. In one day, Dunant witnessed 40,000 soldiers die in battle and countless wounded suffering on the battlefield without any organized medical care.

Fargo and Wells then decided to set up a company in California to provide express delivery and banking services, a company they called Wells Fargo."
DAL_I,"DALAI.    	The Dalai Lama is a religious leader in the Gelug branch of Tibetan Buddhism. The current Dalai Lama is the 14th to hold the office. He has indicated that the next Dalai Lama might be found outside of Tibet for the first time, and may even be female."

This hydrogenation turns good fats into bad fats, so medical professionals suggest limited intake."
