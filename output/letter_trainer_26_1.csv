BIZ_T,"BIZET.    	Georg Bizet was a French composer active in the Romantic era. Bizet's most famous work has to be his opera ""Carmen"". ""Carmen"" initially received a lukewarm reception from the public, even though his fellow composers had nothing but praise for it.

Z_ROG,"ZERO-G.    	The force of gravity that we all feel is referred to as 'one G'. As gravity is a actually an accelerating force, acceleration is measured relative to that force of gravity.

Zero-G is weightlessness that is experienced when in space, outside the influence of the earth's gravity."
WA_DA,"WANDA.    	I think that the 1988 comedy ""A Fish Called Wanda"" is very under-appreciated. The film was co-written by and stars John Cleese, and has an exceptional cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Cleese's friend from ""Monty Python"", Michael Palin. The ""fish"" in the film is the con artist Wanda, played by Curtis."
ENCAR_A,"ENCARTA.    	Microsoft badly wanted to get into the online encyclopedia business in the eighties, and approached the biggest and the best, ""Encyclopaedia Britannica"". ""Britannica"" declined, fearing that an online version would damage their print sales. Of course, ""Britannica"" had to sell eventually, but not to Microsoft, as the inevitable decline in print sales happened anyway. So Microsoft made a deal with ""Funk & Wagnalls"", and started publishing ""Encarta"" in disk form in the early nineties. Usage of Encarta grew, until, along came Wikipedia. Encarta was discontinued in at the end of 2009."

The Basilica of the Sacred Heart (Basilique de Sacré-Coeur) is that gorgeous white structure that sits at the top of the hill known as 'butte Montmartre' in Paris, the highest point in the city.

CAGE_,"CAGER.    	In the early days of basketball, when a ball went out of bounds possession was awarded to the player who first retrieved the ball. This led to mad scuffles off the court, often involving spectators.

It's because of these cages that basketball players are sometimes referred to today as ""cagers""."

ODETO_OY,"ODE TO JOY.    	Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 has to be one of the most recognizable pieces of music in the classical repertoire. ""Ode to Joy"", based on the final movement of the work, is now the anthem of the European Union.

Ed Harris plays Beethoven, and the soundtrack is, of course, superb."

P_ATTE,"PLATTE.    	The Platte River used to be called the Nebrakier, which is an Oto word meaning ""flat river"". Indeed, the state of Nebraska takes its name from 'Nebrakier'.

JOECA_EL,"JOE CAMEL.    	The advertising mascot for Camel cigarettes was officially known as ""Old Joe"", but was popularly known as ""Joe Camel"". Joe originated in the seventies, in an advertising campaign that ran only in Europe where sometimes he was depicted wearing a French Foreign Legion cap. He was imported to the US in 1988 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Camel brand. The big controversy surrounding the use of the camel character was that a 1991 study found that 5-6 year old children could recognize Joe Camel more readily than either Mickey Mouse or Fred Flintstone. Also, soon after Old Joe was introduced in the US, the Camel brand's share of the illegal market to underage smokers went up from 1% to just under 33%."

A nemesis is often someone one cannot seem to beat in competition."
NATAS_A,"NATASHA.    	I have to confess that I have tried to read Leo Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" twice in my life, and failed both times (it is l-o-n-g).

NIKO_,"NIKON.    	Nikon was founded in 1917, a merger of three companies making various optical devices. After the merger, the company's main output was lenses (including the first lenses for Canon cameras, before Canon made its own).

Then, the raider uses the power of the voting rights to convince other voters to change the way the company is run, purely to increase the share price in the relatively short term.
