The NT originally stood for N-Ten, but Microsoft preferred to market it as ""New Technology"". I should note that the information about the ""N-Ten"" derivation comes courtesy of Bill Gates in a 1998 interview. There is a common perception that Windows NT (WNT) takes its name from VMS, an earlier operating system developed by Digital Equipment Corporation. ""WNT"" is what's called a ""Caesar cypher"" of ""VMS"", as you just augment the the letters of VMS alphabetically by one to arrive at WNT.

B_TTE,"BETTE.    	I must confess that I have a problem watching movies starring Bette Davis. I think I must have seen her play one of her more sinister roles when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares or something. So, I have never seen the 1950 classic ""All About Eve"", given that Bette Davis gets top billing. But, the title role of Eve Harrington was played by Anne Baxter, and Ms Baxter's movies I do enjoy.

I think I must have seen her play one of her more sinister roles when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares or something. So, I have never seen the 1950 classic ""All About Eve"", given that Bette Davis gets top billing. But, the title role of Eve Harrington was played by Anne Baxter, and Ms Baxter's movies I do enjoy.

There is a common perception that Windows NT (WNT) takes its name from VMS, an earlier operating system developed by Digital Equipment Corporation.
