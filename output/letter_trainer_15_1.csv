In my part of the world we remember him playing a very debonair hero called Simon Templar in a TV series called ""The Saint"" from 1962 to 1969. .

So, it is the name of the location where the grapes were grown, as opposed to the name of a specific vineyard.

In the following years it became popular for players trying to stay at par to be ""playing against Colonel Bogey"". Then, during WWI, the marching tune ""Colonel Bogey"" was written and named after the golfing term.

Of course these days IEDs are very much in the news in Iraq and Afghanistan."

Dreyfus was a Jewish military officer in the French army, falsely accused and convicted of spying for Germany. Even after the error was discovered, the government refused to back down and let Dreyfus rot away on Devil's Island rather than admit to the mistake.

TAP_S,"TAPAS.    	""Tapa"" is the Spanish word for ""lid"", and there is no clear rationale for why this word came to be used for an appetizer.

TONE_,"TONER.    	The key features of a laser printer (or copier) are that it uses plain paper and produces quality text at high speed. Laser printers work by projecting a laser image of the printed page onto a rotating drum that is coated with photoconductors (material that becomes conductive when exposed to light). The areas of the drum exposed to the laser carry a different charge than the unexposed areas. Dry ink (toner) sticks to the exposed areas due to electrostatic charge. The toner is then transferred to paper by contact and is fused into the paper by the application of heat.

He spent the whole of his time in the Army as a soldier in Cuba. It was much later, in the 1930s, that Sanders went into the restaurant business making his specialty deep-fried chicken. By 1935 his reputation as a ""character"" had grown, so much so that Governor Ruby Laffoon of Kentucky gave Sanders the honorary title of ""Kentucky Colonel"". Later in the fifties, Sanders developed his trademark look with the white suit, string tie, mustache and goatee. When Sanders was 65 however, his business failed and in stepped Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's. Thomas simplified the Sanders menu, cutting it back from over a hundred items to just fried chicken and salads. That was enough to launch KFC into the fast food business. Sanders sold the US franchise in 1964 for just $2 million and moved to Canada to grow KFC north of the border. He died in 1980 and is buried in Louisville, Kentucky. The Colonel's secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices is indeed a trade secret. Apparently there is only one copy of the recipe, a handwritten piece of paper, written in pencil and signed by Colonel Sanders.
