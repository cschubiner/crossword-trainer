PO_H,"POSH.    	No one really knows the etymology of the word ""posh"". The popular myth that POSH stands for ""Port Out, Starboard Home"" is completely untrue, and is a story that can actually be traced back to the 1968 movie ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". The myth is that wealthy British passengers travelling to and from India would book cabins on the port side for the outward journey and the starboard side for the home journey. This trick was supposedly designed to keep their cabins out of the direct sunlight."

G_P,"GAP.    	Famously, there is a gap of 18&#189; minutes in the Nixon White House tapes. Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's secretary, reported that she was reviewing one of the tapes when she accidentally hit record instead of the stop button, causing about 5 minutes of erasure. There is an additional 13 minutes of 'buzzing' that she could not explain. There has been much speculation about what actually happened, as a review of notes made in the meeting covered by the tape show that the arrests made at the Watergate were discussed."
R_NGO,"RINGO.    	Ringo Starr's real name is Richard Starkey. Before he joined the Beatles (replacing drummer Pete Best), Starkey played with the Raving Texans.

ALOUE_TE,"ALOUETTE.    	The French-Canadian children's song starts, ""Alouette, gentille alouette ..."" Alouette is the French word for a bird, the lark. The song is actually pretty gruesome, even though it used to teach children the names of body parts. The origin of the song lies in the French colonists penchant for eating larks, which they considered to be game birds. So in the song, the singer tells the lark he/she will pluck off the lark's head, nose, eyes, wings and tail."

Followers of the Shia tradition believe that leadership should have stayed within the Prophet Muhammad's own family.

His paintings had a sense of depth, setting him apart from his contemporaries. Uccello's most famous work is ""The Battle of San Romano"", a work divided into three large panels. Today, you've got to travel to see all three panels; one is in London, one in Paris, and one in Florence."

The following year the Japanese government officially presented Keller with a replacement dog. Supposedly Keller's dogs were the first members of the breed to be introduced into the US."

The atmosphere of a red giant is also very inflated and extends a long way into space so the surface of that atmosphere that we see is relatively cool, which gives it a red color.

Cool red giants are of a color beyond the usual range, and are classified as S stars."
CA_EO,"CAMEO.    	Even in my day, a cameo role was more than just an short appearance in a movie (or other artistic piece). For the appearance to be a cameo, the actor had to playing him or herself, and was instantly recognizable. With this meaning, it's easy to see the etymology of the term, as a cameo brooch is one with the recognizable carving of the silhouette of a person. Nowadays, a cameo is any minor role played by a celebrity or famous actor, regardless of the character played."

""Djinns"" were various spirits considered lesser than angels, with people exhibiting unsavory characteristics said to be possessed by djinn. When the book ""The Thousand and One Nights"" was translated into French, the word ""djinn"" was transformed into the existing word ""génie"", because of the similarity in sound and the related spiritual meaning. This ""génie"" from the Arabian tale became confused with the Latin-derived ""genius"", a guardian spirit thought to be assigned to each person at birth. Purely as a result of that mistranslation the word genie has come to mean the ""djinn"" that pops out of the bottle. A little hard to follow, I know, but still quite interesting ..."

The missionaries found that they had more success converting the Hutus than the Tutsi, and when the Germans occupied the area during WWI they confiscated Tutsi land and gave it to Hutu tribes in order to reward religious conversion. This injustice fuels fighting to this very day."

RA_EGAS,"RARE GAS.    	The rare gases are better known as the noble gases, but neither term is really very accurate. Noble gas might be a better choice though, as they are all relatively nonreactive.

NINE_,"NINES.    	There's an urban myth that the standard number of holes on a golf course is 18 because it takes 18 shots to polish off a fifth of scotch whisky.

There is a story that he dropped two balls of different masses from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate this, but this probably never happened.

He started building the park at Anaheim, California in 1954, and the facility opened just one year and one day later. The total cost of construction was $17 million.

The opening day went so badly that for years Disney executives referred to it as 'Black Sunday'."

In fact, she took up ballet at the age of twelve to help build up her strength as she recovered from the disease."
ISA_AH,"ISAIAH.    	The Book of Isaiah is part of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. Isaiah is not mentioned in the Qur'an, but many Muslim scholars consider Isaiah a prophet.

_ID,"AID.    	Band-Aid' is a brand name owned by Johnson & Johnson, although like many popular brands 'band-aid' has become the generic term for an adhesive bandage, at least here in North America. The generic term we use in the British Isles for the same product is 'plaster' ..."

The term comes via the Old French 'deien' from the Latin 'decanus', which was the name for the head of a group of ten monks in a monastery, and earlier still, the name for the commander of ten soldiers. So ultimately, 'dean' comes from the Greek 'deka' meaning 'ten'."
_LAM,"ELAM.    	The ancient civilization of Elam was located east of Mesopotamia, in what is modern-day southwest Iran."
_EER,"JEER.    	Not so much here in America, but over in the British Isles ""blowing a raspberry"" is a way of insulting someone (I think it's called ""a Bronx cheer"" in the US). The verb ""to razz"" comes from a shortened form of ""raspberry""."
TH_,"THY.    	The Lord's Prayer is a central prayer in Christian religions, and is found in two places in the New Testament. In the version in the Gospel of Matthew the last line of the prayer is ""deliver from evil"". In the Gospel of Luke the last line is ""lead us not into temptation"". The last words of the prayer as it most often said today are:"
RAV_,"RAVE.    	As you might imagine, I've never been to a rave, and don't have one upcoming in my diary. And as raves often start at 2 a.m. then I'm unlikely ever to experience one.

There hasn't been any mining of any metals in Cornwall since 2007."
TOBE_,"TOBEY.    	The actor Tobey Maguire is most associated with the role of Spider-Man these days. I'm not much into comic book hero films, but I do kind of enjoy the understated way that Maguire takes on 'Spidey'. Maguire has appeared in other hit films, like 'Pleasantville' (1998), 'The Cider House Rules' (1999) and 'Seabiscuit' (2003). Off the screen, he is big into poker and it's said that he has won over $10 million playing poker in Hollywood."

TR_T,"TROT.    	Our use of the word 'derby' to mean a race started in 1780 with the English Derby horse race, which was founded then by the 12th Earl of Derby. Ultimately, the term 'derby' derives from the old English shire of 'Deorby', a word meaning 'deer village'."
E_ES,"ERES.    	We have a big event across Europe every year called the Eurovision Song Contest. Each nation enters one song in competition with each other, and then voters across the whole continent decide on the winner.

""Eres tu"" came second in the competition, but should have won in my humble opinion."
EASTMA_,"EASTMAN.    	George Eastman founded the Eastman Kodak Company, named after the Kodak camera that he had invented four years earlier. He came up with the name of Kodak after careful consideration. Firstly he was a big fan of the letter ""K"", calling is ""string, incisive"". He also wanted a word that short, easy to pronounce and difficult to mispronounce, and a word that was clearly unique with no prior associations. Kodak fit the bill for Eastman."
UPT_N,"UPTON.    	Upton Sinclair was a prolific American author, with almost 100 books to his name. Sinclair's most famous work is probably 'The Jungle', a 1906 novel about the meat packing industry.

The actual distance run today was decided in 1921, and matches the length of the modern-day Marathon-Athens highway."
P_OM,PROM.    	I guess the prom king and prom queen make up the royal court.
_IMI,"JIMI.    	Many of his contemporaries regarded Jimi Hendrix as the greatest electric guitarist in the history of rock music. Hendrix was from Seattle and didn't really have a really stellar start to his working life. He failed to finish high school and fell foul of the law by getting caught in stolen cars, twice. The courts gave him the option of the army or two years in prison. Hendrix chose the former and soon found himself in the famous 101st Airborne. In the army, his less-than-disciplined ways helped him (as he would have seen it) because his superiors successfully petitioned to get him discharged after serving only one year of his two-year requirement, just to get him out of their hair."
GI_A,GINA.    	Gina Gershon is an American actress. Gershon has played a lesbian on screen a number of times and has become somewhat of a gay icon.

ES_,"-EST.    	""The Guinness Book of World Records"" holds some records of its own. It is the best-selling, copyrighted series of books of all time and is one of the books most often stolen from public libraries! The book was first published in 1954 by two twins, Norris and Ross McWhirter. The McWhirter twins found themselves with a smash hit, and eventually became very famous in Britain hosting a TV show based on world records."
_BER,"CBER.    	A CBer is someone who operates a Citizens' Band radio. In 1945, the FCC set aside certain radio frequencies for the personal use of citizens.

ACT_R,"ACTOR.    	Actor Sean Penn is a two-time Oscar winner, for his roles in ""Mystic River"" released in 2003 and ""Milk"" released in 2008. Penn's celebrity on screen is only matched with his fame off the screen. Apart from his ""big name"" marriages to singer Madonna and actress Robin Wright, Penn is also well known for political and social activism. He perhaps inherited some of his political views from his father, actor and director Leo Penn. As an actor, Leo refused to ""name names"" in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee and so was blacklisted in Hollywood and had to move into directing to put bread on the table. In later years as a director he gave his son Sean his first acting role, in a 1974 episode of ""Little House on the Prairie""."

A_GELA,"ANGELA.    	The formidable politician Angela Merkel is the current Chancellor of Germany, the country's head of state.

ACER_,"ACERB.    	'Acerb' is a variant of 'acerbic', meaning sour or bitter-tasting, acidic."
P_SAN,"PISAN.    	Leonardo of Pisa was a famous and respected Italian mathematician, also known as simply 'Fibonacci'.

He wrote about the series of numbers in his book called 'Liber Abaci', a celebrated work that introduced Arabic numerals (i.e. 0-9) to the Western world."
_IL,"TIL.    	Til Tuesday was a New Wave band from Boston that performed and recorded from 1982 to 1988. Aimee Mann got her start with 'Til Tuesday, as bass player and vocalist. The band's best-known song is the hit 'Voices Carry', released in 1985."

They were friends right through high school and became engaged in 1918 just before Harry went off to France during WWI, marrying the next year.

Mrs. Truman lived to the age of 97, the longest living First Lady in US history."

SA_O,"SAGO.    	When I was growing up in Ireland I was very familiar with pearl sago, which is very similar to pearl tapioca. Pearls of sago are simply little balls of sago starch used to make breads, pancakes, biscuits, or the steamed puddings that we ate as kids. Sago comes from pith of the sago palm tree. To get at the starch the tree has to be cut down and the trunk split to reveal the pith. The pith is crushed and manipulated to make the starch available, which is then washed out of a fibrous suspension. One sago palm tree yields about 150-300 kg of starch. Personally I love the stuff, but then, I am a bit weird ..."

It had a unique front-wheel-drive layout that took up very little space, allowing for a lot of room (relatively speaking) for passengers and baggage. One space-saving trick was to mount the engine transversely, so it sits rotated 90 degrees from the norm. That engine had a capacity of only 848cc. In 1961, a Mini Cooper model was introduced, a sporty version of the Mini. The Mini Cooper was a phenomenal hit, especially after repeated wins in the Monte Carlo Rally. The Mini marque has been owned by BMW since 1994."
A_ER,AGER.    	A 'golden ager' is a senior citizen.
_ICE,"RICE.    	We refer to the Japanese alcoholic beverage made from rice as 'sake'. We've gotten things a bit mixed up in the West. 'Sake' is actually the word that the Japanese use for all alcoholic drinks. What we know as sake, we sometimes refer to as rice wine. Also, the starch in the rice is first converted to sugars that are then fermented into alcohol. This is more akin to a beer-brewing process than wine production, so the end product is really a rice 'beer' rather than a rice 'wine'."

SA_O,"SAGO.    	When I was growing up in Ireland I was very familiar with pearl sago, which is very similar to pearl tapioca. Pearls of sago are simply little balls of sago starch used to make breads, pancakes, biscuits, or the steamed puddings that we ate as kids. Sago comes from pith of the sago palm tree. To get at the starch the tree has to be cut down and the trunk split to reveal the pith. The pith is crushed and manipulated to make the starch available, which is then washed out of a fibrous suspension. One sago palm tree yields about 150-300 kg of starch.

In the seventies, astronomers began to discover more large objects in the solar system, including Eris, a ""scattered disc object"" at the outer reaches. Given that Eris is actually bigger than Pluto, and other objects really aren't that much smaller, Pluto's status as a planet was drawn into question.

RAR_GAS,"RARE GAS.    	The rare gases are better known as the noble gases, but neither term is really very accurate. Noble gas might be a better choice though, as they are all relatively nonreactive.

LI_O,"LILO.    	""Lilo & Stitch"" was released by Disney in 2002.

LEDs were used in early digital watches, and are getting more and more popular even though their use in electronic equipment is fading away.

However, Lhasa used to be called Rasa, a name that translates into the less auspicious 'goat's place'. Lhasa was also once called the 'Forbidden City' due to its inaccessible location high in the Himalayas and a traditional hostility exhibited by residents to outsiders. The 'forbidden' nature of the city has been reinforced since the Chinese took over Tibet in the early 1950s as it has been difficult for foreigners to get permission to visit Lhasa."

SPE_,"SPEE.    	The Battle of the Falkland Islands was an engagement in 1914 between the British Royal Navy and the Imperial German Navy.

Burroughs-Wellcome came up with treatment regime using AZT, and filed a patent in 1985. The patent was challenged in court, but the patent expired anyway in 2005 without any decision being made.
