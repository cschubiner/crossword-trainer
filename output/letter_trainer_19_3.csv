Rinty featured in some films, eventually getting his first starring role in 1923 in the silent movie ""Where the North Begins"". Legend has it that this first Rin Tin Tin died in the arms of actress Jean Harlow. Not a bad way to go ..."
LO_ITA,"LOLITA.    	Vladimir Nabokov's novel ""Lolita"" has a famously controversial storyline, dealing with a middle-aged man's obsession and sexual relationship with a 12-year-old girl. Although ""Lolita"" is considered a classic today, after Nabokov finished it in 1953 the edgy subject matter made it impossible for him to find a publisher in the US (where Nabokov lived). In 1955, he resorted to publishing it in English at a printing house in Paris. Publication was followed by bans and seizures all over Europe. A US printing house finally took on the project in 1958, by which time the title had such a reputation that it sold exceptionally quickly. ""Lolita"" became the first book since ""Gone with the Wind"" to sell over 100,000 copies in its first three weeks in stores."
_ICE,"DICE.    	As we all know, the numbers on dice are arranged so that the opposite faces add up to seven. Given this arrangement, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 all meet at a common vertex. Now, there are two ways of arranging the 1, 2 and 3 around the common vertex, a so called right-handed die (clockwise 1-2-3) or a left-handed die (counterclockwise 1-2-3). Traditionally, dice used in Western cultures are right-handed, whereas Chinese dice are left-handed. Quite interesting ..."
I_S,"IDS.    	The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was of course created in 2001, soon after the 9/11 attacks."

The beautiful and talented actress Halle Berry was the first African American woman to win a Best Actress Oscar, which she received for her performance in the 2001 movie ""Monster's Ball"".

ACID_,"ACIDS.    	Saturated fats differ from unsaturated fats chemically in that saturated fats have chains of fatty acids that are relatively straight, allowing individual molecules to pack closely together. This close packing largely explains why saturated fats are solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fatty acids on the other hand have ""kinks"" in the chains of their fatty acids, so that they cannot pack together closely. Unsaturated fats are generally liquid at room temperature. Food manufacturers have learned that humans get sick by consuming saturated fats (i.e. fats from animal sources). So, they market ""healthy"" vegetable fats (naturally unsaturated and liquid at room temperature) that they have magically transformed in solid fats (like vegetable spreads). All they did was saturate the healthy fats, so that now it solidifies at room temperature, and in your arteries. There should be a law ..."
CAA_,"CAAN.    	The 1990 film 'Misery' is an adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name. I think it's the only movie of a King book that I've watched and enjoyed. I can't stomach his books, not because of the writing, but because of the gruesome scenes that are part of the plots. The screen version of 'Misery' is toned down a little from the original storyline. In the novel, the Kathy Bates character amputates the James Caan character's foot to incapacitate him. In the movie she just smashes his ankles. Big difference ..."
_RYSTS,"TRYSTS.    	In its most general sense, a tryst is a meeting at an agreed time and place. More usually it is associated with a prearranged meeting between lovers. The term comes from the Old French 'triste', a waiting place designated when hunting."

_RK,"ORK.    	""Mork & Mindy"" was broadcast from 1978 to 1982. We were first introduced to Mork (played by Robin Williams, of course) in a special episode of ""Happy Days"". The particular episode in question has a bizarre storyline culminating in Fonzie and Mork having a thumb-to-finger duel. Eventually Richie wakes up in bed, and alien Mork was just part of a dream! Oh, and ""Nanu Nanu"" means both ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" back on the planet Ork. ""I am Mork from Ork, Nanu Nanu"". Great stuff ..."

RI_,RIM.    	That would be in basketball.
PO_OY,"PO' BOY.    	A po' boy is a submarine sandwich from Louisiana. There are a lot of theories about where the name came from, and none sound too convincing to me. A po' boy differs from a regular submarine sandwich in that it uses Louisiana French bread, which is soft in the middle and crusty on the outside."
T_TRA,"TETRA.    	The neon tetra is a freshwater fish, native to parts of South America. It is a very popular aquarium fish, and millions are imported into the US every year. Almost all of the imported tetras are farm-raised in Asia, and very few come from their native continent."

Tessa is a maiden selected as a bride in a ""line up"" by one of the gondoliers. I last saw ""The Gondoliers"" decades ago, an amateur production in the small town where I was living at the time in Ireland. Good fun!"
E_INA,"EDINA.    	Edina, Minnesota lies just southwest of Minneapolis. The town takes its name from Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland. It was suggested by a Scottish mill owner at the time a new village was being set up in 1888."

NAI_,"NAIR.    	Nair is a hair removal product that has some pretty harsh ingredients. The most important active constituents are calcium hydroxide (""slake lime"") and sodium hydroxide (""caustic soda""). The balance of Nair's makeup seem to be there to soothe the skin after the harsher chemicals have done their job. The name ""Nair"" probably comes from combining ""no"" and ""hair""."
_ITAN,"TITAN.    	Titan is the largest moon of Saturn. Titan is unusual in many ways, including the fact that it is the only known satellite in the solar system that is has its own atmosphere (our own moon does not, for example). Titan is the second largest moon in the solar system, after Ganymede that orbits Jupiter. Titan is so large that it has a greater volume than Mercury, the solar system's smallest planet."
O_TOPI,"OCTOPI.    	The name 'octopus' comes from the Greek for 'eight-footed'. The most common plural used is 'octopuses', although the Greek plural form 'octopodes' is also quite correct. The plural 'octopi' isn't really correct as the inference is that 'octopus' is like a second-declension Latin noun, which it isn't. That said, dictionaries are now citing 'octopi' as an acceptable plural."

B_YN,"BRYN.    	I used to live not far from Bryn-mawr (also Brynmwar) in Wales, the town with the highest elevation in the country. Appropriately enough, bryn mawr is Welsh for ""big hill"".

At the Pennsylvania location there's a Brynn Mawr college, a private women's school that was the first American university to offer graduate degrees to women."
_OM,"DOM.    	Dom PÃ©rignon is the name given to the prestige label of champagne from MoÃ«t et Chandon, the French winery. The label's name honors the Benedictine monk, Dom PÃ©rignon, who helped to improve the quality and production of champagne in the early 18th century. Although Dom PÃ©rignon made major contributions to the production of champagne, many of the stories in which he figures are just myths. He did not ""invent"" champagne, nor sparkling wine in general. Nor did he say the famous words, ""Come quickly, I am drinking the stars!"". That lovely line first appeared in a print advertisement in the late 1800s!"
H_H,HRH.    	His or Her Royal Highness.

E_Q,"ESQ.    	The title ""esquire"" is of British origin, and is used differently today depending on whether one is in the US or the UK. Here in America, the term is usually reserved for those practicing the law (both male and female). In the UK it is a term of gentle respect, reserved for a male who has no other title that one can use. So, a mere commoner like me might receive a letter from the bank say, addressed to W. E.

The RAF's ""finest hour"" has to be the Battle of Britain when the vastly outnumbered British fighters fought off the might of the Luftwaffe causing Hitler to delay his plan to cross the English Channel. This outcome prompted Winston Churchill to utter the memorable words:"

_TEEL,"STEEL.    	During WWII there was a shortage of copper, so the US Mint switched to zinc-coated steel for production of one-cent coins in 1943.

John was by then in a committed relationship with Yoko Ono, and well into the 'revolutionary' phase of his life.

_SENET,"USENET.    	Remember the good old days, when you'd read messages online in ""newsgroups""? Well, that system of aggregating public messages is known as Usenet, and it's still around today. Usenet started operating in 1980, some ten years before the World Wide Web was introduced (the system that has taken over from Usenet in terms of popularity).

B_CA,"BOCA.    	The name of the city of Boca Raton in Florida translates from Spanish as 'Mouse Mouth'. There doesn't seem to be a definitive etymology of the name but one plausible explanation is a nautical one. 'Boca', as well as meaning 'mouth' can mean 'inlet'. 'RatÃ³n', as well as meaning 'mouse' was also used to describe rocks that chewed away at a ship's anchor cable. So possibly Boca Raton was named for a rocky inlet."

The beautiful and talented actress Halle Berry was the first African American woman to win a Best Actress Oscar, which she received for her performance in the 2001 movie ""Monster's Ball"".

This event sparked the Trojan War that waged between the city of Troy and Greece. Because of this war, Helen was said to have 'the face that launched a thousand ships'.

"T.N_G.""","T.N.G."".    	Deanna Troi, the character on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", is played by the lovely Marina Sirtis. Sirtis is a naturalized American citizen and has what I would call a soft, American accent on the show. However, she was born in the East End of London and has a natural accent off-stage that is more like that of a true Cockney."
N_EST,"N-TEST.    	There are two classes of nuclear weapons, both of which get the energy for the explosion from nuclear reactions. The first nuclear bombs developed, called atomic bombs (A-bombs), use fission reactions. In an atomic bomb, uranium nuclei are split into smaller nuclei with the release of an awful lot of energy in the process. The second class of nuclear weapons are fusion bombs. Fusion devices are also called thermonuclear weapons or hydrogen bombs (H-bombs). In a fusion reaction, the nuclei of hydrogen isotopes are fused together to form bigger nuclei, with the release of even greater amounts of energy than a fission reaction."

ON_,"ON A.    	""Three on a match"" is a superstition, apparently dating back to the Crimean War. If three people light their cigarette from the same match, then supposedly one of the soldiers would be killed. A further superstition, called ""third on a match"" was that the third soldier who gets the light would be killed. The rationale was that if an enemy sniper saw the light of a match, he would take aim as the first person takes the light, determine whether he was seeing friend or foe with the second lighting, and then shoot at the third lighting."
L_S,"LYS.    	""Lys"" is the French word for ""lily"", as in fleur-de-lys, the heraldic symbol often associated with the French monarchy."
C_M,"CAM.    	From what I just read, it is legal to record video with a hidden camera, at least to monitor the behavior of a caregiver in your home. Apparently there is a law, however, that prohibits the recording of audio. So, ""nanny cams"" are sold without audio capability. But (disclaimer) that's just what I read, so don't take my word for it!"
EILE_N,"EILEEN.    	Eileen Collins was the first female pilot of a Space Shuttle, and the first female commander of a Space Shuttle mission. She was also the first astronaut to fly the shuttle through the 360-degree, rendezvous pitch maneuver. This maneuver became routine for Shuttles in docking with the International Space Station.

He is a devout atheist, a libertarian and a supporter of free-market capitalism."
_IN,"SIN.    	Las Vegas, Nevada was founded as a city in 1905. It became a stop-off point for pioneers travelling west, and eventually a railroad town, although with the coming of the railroad growth halted as folks began to bypass Las Vegas. The city's tourism industry took off in 1935 with the completion of the nearby Hoover Dam, and visitors to Vegas take tours of the dam to this day. Then gambling was legalized, and things really started to move. Vegas was picked, largely by celebrated figures in ""the mob"", as a convenient location across the California/Nevada state line that could service the vast population of Los Angeles. As a result, Las Vegas became the most populous US city founded in the 20th century (an honor that had belonged to Chicago in the 19th century)."

He was a noted rugby player and swimmer, and for nine years held the Ugandan national light-heavyweight boxing title. By the early seventies, Amin was commander of all the armed forces of Uganda and in 1971 seized power in a military coup, displacing the country's president Milton Obote. There followed seven years of brutal rule by Amin during which it is estimated that between 100,000 and 500,000 people were murdered.

Several disparate forces with policing responsibility were amalgamated in 1844 to form the New York City Police Department, signalling the end of the night watch force that had existed for over 200 years."
K_TIE,"KATIE.    	As casting proceeded for the movie version of ""Gone With the Wind"", Clark Gable was a shoo-in from day one. The role of Scarlett was considered very desirable in the acting community, with Bette Davis on the short list, and Katherine Hepburn demanding an appointment with producer David O. Selznick to discuss the role. Vivien Leigh was an unlikely contender, an English actress for the definitive Southern belle role. Selznick was adamant though, and stuck by his choice despite a lot of protests."

The label's name honors the Benedictine monk, Dom PÃ©rignon, who helped to improve the quality and production of champagne in the early 18th century. Although Dom PÃ©rignon made major contributions to the production of champagne, many of the stories in which he figures are just myths. He did not ""invent"" champagne, nor sparkling wine in general. Nor did he say the famous words, ""Come quickly, I am drinking the stars!"". That lovely line first appeared in a print advertisement in the late 1800s!"
EK_S,"EKES.    	I believe that technically speaking one can't actually ""eke out"" an existence, as to ""eke out"" means to ""make something go further or last longer"". So, you can eke out your income by cutting back on expenses, but you can't eke out your existence, or any existence."

With 46% sugar content, the rabbit probably wouldn't have liked it anyway ..."

A_E,"AXE.    	Hansel and Gretel is a Germanic fairy tale found in the collection of the Brothers Grimm. It tells of two siblings, Hansel and Gretel, the children of a woodcutter, who are abandoned in a forest at the behest of an evil stepmother.

"_.N.G.""","T.N.G."".    	When Gene Roddenberry was creating the 'Star Trek' spin-off series 'Star Trek: The Next Generation', I think he chose a quite magnificent name for the new starship captain.

The role of Picard was of course played by the wonderful Shakespearean actor Patrick Stewart."
A_ONIS,"ADONIS.    	In Greek mythology Adonis is a beautiful, young god loved by Aphrodite. He dies in a hunting accident (gored by a boar), but not before he gives Aphrodite a child.
