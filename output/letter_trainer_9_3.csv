But still, Arthur Andersen collapsed under the weight of the scandal and 85,000 people lost their jobs (despite only a handful being directly involved with Enron)."
_TL,"STL.    	The St. Louis Cardinals were originally called the ""Brown Stockings"", changing their name to the ""Perfectos"" in 1899. That name change obviously didn't go down well with the locals, as the owners changed it one year later to the Cardinals."
EAR_,"EARP.    	The legendary Western gunfighter and lawman Wyatt Earp has been portrayed on the big and small screen many, many times. Kevin Costner played the title role in 1994's 'Wyatt Earp', and Val Kilmer played Earp in 2012's 'The First Ride of Wyatt Earp'. Joel McCrea had the part in 1955's 'Wichita', and Kurt Russell was Earp in 1993's 'Tombstone'."

EL_,"ELY.    	The Isle of Ely in England isn't an island as we would usually know it, and instead is the name of the area surrounding the city of Ely. Centuries ago however, the region was in fact an island surrounded by a fen, a type of swamp. The name is said to derive from 'Island of Eels', a reference to the large number of eels caught in the area's rivers."
LO_,"LON.    	Lon Chaney, Sr. played a lot of crazed-looking characters in the days of silent movies. He did much of his own make-up work, developing the grotesque appearances that became his trademark, and earning himself the nickname ""the man of a thousand faces"". Most famous of all was his portrayal of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" in 1925."
E_RP,"EARP.    	The legendary Western gunfighter and lawman Wyatt Earp has been portrayed on the big and small screen many, many times.

N_N,"NAN.    	The 'Bobbsey Twins' series of children's novels was first written by Edward Stratemeyer in 1904. Stratemeyer used the pseudonym Laura Lee Hope, as did subsequent authors who wrote 72 books in the series between 1904 and 1979. The title characters were two sets of fraternal twins, one called Bert and Nan (who were 12) and the other called Flossie and Freddie (who were 6)."
_IN,"GIN.    	The name ""martini"" probably takes it name from the ""Martini & Rossi"" brand of dry vermouth, although no one seems to be completely sure. What is clear, is that despite the Martini name originating in Italy, the martini drink originated in the US."
SE_NE,"SEINE.    	The famous 'Left Bank' ('La Rive Gauche') of the River Seine in Paris is the river's southern bank. The area south of the river was traditionally quite affluent and was home to artists, students and intellectuals."

_AR,UAR.    	The United Arab Republic (UAR) was a union between Egypt and Syria made in 1958 and dissolved in 1961 when Syria pulled out of the arrangement.
S_AM,"SPAM.    	Apparently the term ""SPAM"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word SPAM, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""SPAM"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."

RA_U,"RAGU.    	The Ragú brand of pasta sauce is owned by Unilever. The name "" Ragù"" is the Italian word for a sauce used to dress pasta, however the spelling is off a little. In Italian the word is ""Ragù"" with a grave accent over the ""u"", but if you look at a jar of the Unilever sauce, it is spelled ""Ragú"" on the label, with an acute accent. Sometimes I think we just don't try ..."
CR_,"CRO.    	Remains of early man, dating back to 35,000 years ago, were found in Abri de Cro-Magnon in southwest France, giving the name to those early humans. Cro-Magnon remains are the oldest human relics that have been discovered in Europe."
OH_RA,"O'HARA.    	BUtterfield 8' (note the capitalization of both the 'B' and the 'U') is a film released in 1960 starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey. The title of the movie, and of the John O'Hara novel on which the film is based, is actually a telephone number. Up to the mid-sixties, telephone exchanges were given names rather than numbers. BUtterfield 8 was an exchange in the wealthy Upper East Side of Manhattan, and dialling of BU-8 was equivalent to 28-8, the first three digits of a 7-digit phone number."
DO_,"DOE.    	Though the English court system does not use the term today, John Doe first appeared as the ""name of a person unknown"" in England in 1659, along with another unknown, Richard Roe. Joe Blow is just a variant of John Doe, and Jane Doe is an unknown female."
LT_,"LTD.    	In Britain and Ireland the most common type of business (my perception anyway) is one that has private shareholders whose liability is limited to the value of their investment. Such a company is known as a private limited company, and has the letters ""Ltd"" after the name. If the shares are publicly traded, then the company is a public limited company, and has the letters ""plc"" after the name."
LA_,"LAV.    	Our word 'lavatory' originally referred to a washbasin, and comes from the Latin 'lavatorium', a place for washing. In the 1600s a ""lavatory"" came to mean a washroom, and in the 1920s a toilet."

Y_L,"YSL.    	Yves Saint-Laurent was a French fashion designer, actually born in Algeria. He started off working as an assistant to Christian Dior at the age of 17. Dior died just four years later, and as a very young man Saint-Laurent was named head of the House of Dior. However, in 1950 Saint-Laurent was conscripted into the French Army and ended up in a military hospital after suffering a mental breakdown from the hazing inflicted on him by his fellow soldiers. His treatment included electroshock therapy and administration of sedatives and psychoactive drugs. He was released from prison, managed to pull his life back together, and started his own fashion house. Remarkable ..."
_EINE,"SEINE.    	Paradoxically, Pont Neuf is the oldest bridge standing today that crosses the River Seine in Paris. The paradox is that the name translates to 'new bridge'. The bridge is in two parts, as it crosses from the Left Bank to the Île de la Cité (on which stands Notre Dame) and then from the Île de la Cité to the Right Bank."
A_IA,"AVIA.    	The Avia brand name for athletic shoes was chosen as ""avia"" is the Latin word for ""to fly"", and suggests the concept of aviation. Avia was founded in Oregon in 1979."
SP_M,"SPAM.    	I think it may be true that the term SPAM for unwanted email is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch, the dialog is taken over by the word SPAM, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets in Britain after WWII. So SPAM is a term for emails that take over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon."
AT_,ATV.    	All-terrain vehicle (ATV)
_UR,"SUR.    	Big Sur is lovely part of the California Coast, south of Monterrey and Carmel. The name ""Big Sur"" comes from the original Spanish description of the area as ""el sur grande"" meaning ""the big south""."
EN_ON,"ENRON.    	After all the trials following the exposure of fraud at Enron, several of the key players ended up in jail. Andrew Fastow was the Chief Financial Officer. Fastow plea-bargained and received ten years without parole, and became the key witness in the trials of others. Even Fastow's wife was involved, and was sentenced to one year for helping her husband hide money. Jeffrey Skilling (ex-CEO) was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months. Kenneth Lay (CEO) died in 2006 after he had been found guilty and before he could be sentenced. The accounting firm Arthur Andersen was found guilty of obstruction of justice for shredding thousands of pertinent documents and deleting emails and files (a decision that the Supreme Court later overturned on a technicality). But still, Arthur Andersen collapsed under the weight of the scandal and 85,000 people lost their jobs (despite only a handful being directly involved with Enron)."
CA_,"CAD.    	Our word ""cad"", meaning ""a person lacking in finer feelings"", is a shortening of the word ""cadet"".

AB_,"ABO.    	The most important grouping of blood types is the ABO system. Blood is classified as either A, B, AB or O, depending on the type of antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. A secondary designation of blood is the Rh factor, in which a different set of antigens is labelled as either positive or negative. When a patient receives a blood transfusion, ideally the donor blood should be the same type as that of the recipient, as incompatible blood cells can be rejected. However, blood type O-Neg can be accepted by recipients with all blood types, AB or O, positive or negative. Hence someone with O-neg blood type is called a ""universal donor""."
_ENA,"XENA.    	The Xena character, famously played by actress Lucy Lawless, was introduced in a made-for-TV movie called 'Hercules and the Amazon Women'. Lawless reprised the role in a series called ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"". Xena became so popular that a series was built around her character, with Lawless retained for the role."

More concentrated grades of lye are used to clear drains and clean ovens. Scary ..."
DA_,"DAN.    	Actor John Goodman will forever be remembered as Dan Conner, the on-screen husband of Roseanne Barr in the sitcom ""Roseanne"". Goodman went to Missouri State University where he studied drama and was a compatriot of Kathleen Turner.

And right now I am really lapping up his latest show, the Amazon sitcom 'Alpha House'."

In fact, after the fire died down, the executioner raked the coals to display the charred body, proving Joan had died, and then burned the corpse again, twice, so that relics could not be collected.

In the famous sketch the dialog is taken over by the word SPAM, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets in Britain after WWII. So SPAM is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."

C_I,"CHI.    	""The Chicago Tribune"" was first published in 1847. The most famous edition of ""The Trib"" was probably in 1948 when the headline was ""DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN"", on the occasion of that year's presidential election. When it turned out Truman had actually won, the victor picked up the paper with the erroneous headline and posed for photographs with it ... a famous, famous photo, that must have stuck in the craw of the editor at the time."
_AD,"CAD.    	Our word ""cad"", meaning ""a person lacking in finer feelings"", is a shortening of the word ""cadet"".

And then Rachel Carson published her famous book ""Silent Spring"", suggesting there was a link between DDT and diminishing populations of certain wildlife. It was the public outcry sparked by the book, and reports of links between DDT and cancer, that led to the ban on the use of the chemical in 1972. That ban is touted as the main reason that the bald eagle was rescued from near extinction."
EN_,ENG.    	Today there are six official languages of the United Nations:
S_EET,"SLEET.    	Apparently ""sleet"" is a term used to describe two weather conditions. One is a shower of ice pellets, smaller than hail, and the second is a mixture of rain and snow, with the snow melting as it falls. It's the second definition that I have always used ..."

CH_,"CHI.    	The Chicago Cubs are one of only two teams still playing that are charter members of baseball's National League (the other is the Atlanta braves).

DDT was used with great success to control disease-carrying insects during WWII, and when made available for use after the war it became by far the most popular pesticide.

It was the public outcry sparked by the book, and reports of links between DDT and cancer, that led to the ban on the use of the chemical in 1972. That ban is touted as the main reason that the bald eagle was rescued from near extinction."

_IN,"GIN.    	The original tonic water was a fairly strong solution of the drug quinine dissolved in carbonated water. It was used in tropical areas in South Asia and Africa where malaria is rampant. The quinine has a prophylactic effect against the disease, and was formulated as ""tonic water"" so that it could be easily distributed. In British colonial India, the colonial types got into the habit of mixing in gin with the tonic water to make it more palatable by hiding the bitter taste of the quinine. Nowadays, the level of quinine in tonic water has been dropped, and sugar has been added."
D_N,"DAN.    	""The Da Vinci Code"" is an excellent story, written by Dan Brown. However, Brown's first book to feature the character Robert Langdon was even better in my opinion, namely ""Angels & Demons""."
TI_A,"TINA.    	Comic actress Tina Fey has a scar on her face a few inches long on her left cheek, which I was shocked to learn was caused by a childhood ""slashing"" incident.

RR_,RRS.    	Railroads (RRs)
IR_,"IRT.    	The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) was the original private operator of the New York Subway when it opened in 1904. The city took over ownership of the system in 1940, but the lines originally operated by the IRT are still known by the IRT moniker."

That ban is touted as the main reason that the bald eagle was rescued from near extinction."
RA_A,"RAGA.    	Raga isn't really a type of music, but has been described as the ""tonal framework"" in which Indian classical music is composed. Ravi Shankar was perhaps the most famous raga virtuoso (to us Westerners). Western rock music with a heavy Indian influence might be called raga rock."
A_C,"ABC.    	Modern Family' is a marvelous television show shown on ABC since 2009. The show's format is that of a 'mockumentary', with the cast often addressing the camera directly. In that respect 'Modern Family' resembles two other excellent shows: 'The Office' and 'Parks and Recreation', both of which might also be described a 'mockumentaries'."
C_D,"CAD.    	Our word ""cad"", meaning ""a person lacking in finer feelings"", is a shortening of the word ""cadet"".

AS_RO,"ASTRO.    	The Jetsons' is an animated show from Hanna-Barbera that had its first run in 1962-1963, and then was recreated in 1985-1987. When it was debuted in 1963 by ABC, ""The Jetsons"" was the network's first ever color broadcast. 'The Jetsons' are like a space-age version of 'The Flintstones'. The four Jetson family members are George and Jane, the parents, and children Judy and Elroy. Residing with the family are Rosie the household robot, and Astro the pet dog."
_EAN,"SEAN.    	Sean Connery wasn't the first choice for the role of James Bond. Six potential actors were selected for a screen test, after which a 28-year-old model was chosen called Peter Anthony. It turned out that Anthony wasn't up to the part, and so second-choice Connery was given a call."
Y_L,"YSL.    	Yves Saint-Laurent was a French fashion designer, actually born in Algeria. He started off working as an assistant to Christian Dior at the age of 17. Dior died just four years later, and as a very young man Saint-Laurent was named head of the House of Dior.

His treatment included electroshock therapy and administration of sedatives and psychoactive drugs.

I do know her from ""House"" though. She played the hospital's lawyer, and Greg House's ex-partner. That was a fun role, I thought."
RAV_,"RAVI.    	Ravi Shankar was perhaps the most famous virtuoso (to us Westerners) from the world of Indian classical music, and was noted for his sitar playing. Shankar was the father of the beautiful singer Norah Jones."
S_L,"STL.    	The St. Louis Cardinals were originally called the 'Brown Stockings', changing their name to the 'Perfectos' in 1899. That obviously didn&#8217;t go down well with the locals, as the owners changed it one year later to the Cardinals."

ESS_Y,"ESSAY.    	Charles Lamb published a famous collection of essays simply entitled ""Essays of Elia"". Elia was actually a clerk and co-worker of Charles Lamb, whereas Lamb was the author."
_NISE,"ANISE.    	Liquorice (also licorice) and aniseed do indeed have similar flavors, but they come from unrelated plants. The liquorice plant is a legume like a bean, and the sweet flavor is an extract from the roots. The flavor mainly comes from an ether compound called anethole, the same substance that gives the distinctive flavor to anise. The seedpods of the anise plant are what we know as ""aniseed"". The anise seeds themselves are usually ground to release the flavor."
ETU_,"ETUI.    	An etui is an ornamental case used to hold small items, in particular sewing needles. We imported both the case design and the word ""etui"" from France. The French also have a modern usage of ""etui"", using the term to depict a case for carrying CDs."

R_GU,"RAGU.    	The Ragu brand of pasta sauce is owned by Unilever. The name "" Ragù"" is the Italian word for a sauce used to dress pasta, however the spelling is off a little. In Italian the word is ""Ragù"" with a grave accent over the ""u"", but if you look at a jar of the Unilever sauce, it is spelled ""Ragú"" on the label, with an acute accent. Sometimes I think we just don't try ..."
_NIL,"ANIL.    	Anil is another name for the indigo plant, as well as the name for the blue indigo dye that is obtained from it. The color of anil is relatively close to navy blue."
_PAM,"SPAM.    	Apparently the term ""SPAM"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word SPAM, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""SPAM"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication. I can just imagine nerdy Internet types (like me) adopting something from a ""Monty Python"" sketch to describe an online phenomenon ..."

SA_A,"SARA.    	Sara Bareilles achieved success with her 2007 'Love Song' with the help of the iTunes online store.

P_I,"PHI.    	Phi Beta Kappa was the first collegiate Greek fraternity in the US, founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary. The organization served as a model for future collegiate fraternities and sororities, although in the 19th century Phi Beta Kappa distanced itself from the fraternal focus and transformed into the honor society that it is today, recognizing academic excellence. The initials Phi Beta Kappa stand for 'philosophia biou kybernētēs', which translates into 'philosophy is the guide of life'. The symbol of the Phi Beta Kappa Society is a golden key."
R_M,"RPM.    	The first vinyl records designed to play at 33 1/3 rpm were introduced by RCA Victor in 1931, but were discontinued due to quality problems.

AR_NA,"ARENA.    	Arena Football is played indoors, on a smaller field that American (and Canadian) football. The sport was invented in 1981, and the Arena Football League (AFL) was around from 1987 till 2008. There's a new AFL in business now, which started playing games in 2010 apparently."

And then Rachel Carson published her famous book ""Silent Spring"", suggesting there was a link between DDT and diminishing populations of certain wildlife. It was the public outcry sparked by the book, and reports of links between DDT and cancer, that led to the ban on the use of the chemical in 1972. That ban is touted as the main reason that the bald eagle was rescued from near extinction."

LT_,"LTD.    	There has been a lot of speculation about what the abbreviation LTD stands for in the car model known as ""Ford LTD"". Many say it is an initialism standing for Luxury Trim Decor, and others say that it is short for ""limited"". Although the car was produced in Australia with the initialism meaning Lincoln Type Design, it seems LTD was originally chosen as just three meaningless letters that sound well together."
US_,"USO.    	The United Service Organization (USO) was founded in 1941 at the request of FDR ""to handle the on-leave recreation of the men in the armed forces"". A USO tour is undertaken by a troupe of entertainers, many of whom are big-name celebrities. A USO tour usually includes troop locations in combat zones."
P_A,PSA.    	Public service announcement (PSA)
_WO,"TWO.    	Since the days of President George Washington, there was an informal tradition that a US President could hold office for two terms, but would not run for a third. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the only president to break with this tradition. President Roosevelt was elected to office four times, and died a few months after starting his fourth term. It was President Roosevelt's decision to ignore the term limit tradition that led to the adoption of the Twenty-Second Amendment of the Constitution, which provides that 'no person shall be elected to the office of President more than twice'."
CL_,"CLE.    	The Cleveland baseball franchise started out in 1869 as the Forest Citys named after ""Forest City"", which is the nickname for Cleveland. After a number of transitions, in 1914 the team took on the name ""Indians"". The media came up with name ""Indians"" after being asked for suggestions by the team owners. ""Indians"" was inspired by the successful Boston team of the day, the Boston Braves."

PH_,"PHI.    	The golden ratio, denoted by the Greek letter phi, is a mathematical constant that often turns up in the world of art. Phi is approximately equal to 1.61, and is represented by the two distances, a and b, where (a+b)/a = a/b. Somehow we perceive the ratio of 1.61 as ""pleasing"" so it appears in many works of art and in building design. For example, many aspects of the Parthenon in Athens have the ratio of 1.61 (width compared to height). Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing of the Vitruvian Man also illustrates the golden ratio in the proportions of the human body, where he shows that the distance from the foot to the navel, compared to the distance from the navel to the head, is 1.61."

_AV,"LAV.    	When I was growing up in Ireland, a ""bathroom"" was a room that had a bath and no toilet. The separate room with the commode was called ""the toilet"" or sometimes the W.C. (the water closet). Apparently the term closet was used because in the 1800s when homeowners started installing toilets indoors they often displaced clothes in a ""closet"", as a closet was the right size to take the commode. It has been suggested that the British term ""loo"" comes from Waterloo (water-closet ... water-loo), but no one seems to know for sure."

SPA_,"SPAM.    	I think that the oft-quoted story may be true that the term ""SPAM"", used for unwanted email, is taken from a ""Monty Python"" sketch. In the sketch (which I've seen) the dialog is taken over by the word SPAM, a play on the glut of canned meat in the markets of Britain after WWII. So ""SPAM"" is used for the glut of emails that takes over online communication.
