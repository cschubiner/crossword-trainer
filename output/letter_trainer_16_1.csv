IN_IA,"INDIA.    	The Kingdom of Bhutan is located between India and China, at the eastern end of the Himalayas.

By using the collar, for many frames all they had to do was redraw everything from the collar up, saving them lots and lots of time."
_RISH,"IRISH.    	There is a fair amount known about St. Patrick, some of which comes from two letters written in his own hand. St. Patrick lived in the fifth century, but was not born in Ireland. He was first brought to Ireland at about 16 years of age from his native Britain, by Irish raiders who made him a slave for six years. Patrick managed to escape and returned to his homeland where he studied and entered the Church. He went back to Ireland as a bishop and a missionary and there lived out the rest of his life. There seems to be good evidence that he died on March 17th (now celebrated annually as St. Patrick's Day), although the year is less clear. The stories about shamrock and snakes, I am afraid they are the stuff of legend."

OR_N,"ORAN.    	Oran lies on the Algerian coast, and is famous for being the port where the French Navy was largely destroyed by the British during WWII in order to avoid the French vessels falling into the hands of Nazi Germany after France surrendered.

_FLAC,"AFLAC.    	In 1999 Aflac was huge in the world of insurance but it wasn't a household name, so a New York advertising agency was given the task of making the Aflac brand more memorable.

The terms ""premier cru"" and ""grand cru"" are also used, but the usage depends on the specific wine region.

'Grand cru' is reserved for the very best vineyards, with 'premier cru' the level just below."
S_AR,"SCAR.    	The word ""tattoo"" was first used in English in the writings of the famous English explorer Captain Cook. In his descriptions of the indelible marks adorning the skin of Polynesian natives, he anglicized the Tahitian word ""tatau"" into our ""tattoo""."

It's also known as ""Butterfield's Lullaby"" as it is a variation of an older bugle call named the ""Scott Tattoo"", arranged during the Civil War by the Union Army's Brigadier General Daniel Butterfield. The tune is called ""taps"", from the notion of drum taps, as it was originally played on a drum, and only later on a bugle. The whole tune comprises just 24 notes, with there only being four different notes within the 24 i.e. 'low G', C, E and 'high G'. Minimalism at its best ..."

"I,ROB_T","I, ROBOT.    	Isaac Asimov was a wonderful science fiction writer, and a professor of biochemistry. He was a favorite author as I was growing up and I must admit that some hero worship on my part led me to study and work as a biochemist for a short while early in my career.

_ION,"LION.    	The Lion of Judah is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, and was the symbol of the Israelite tribe of Judah.

_LCID,"EL CID.    	""El Cid"" is an epic film released in 1961 that tells the story of the Castilian knight who was known as El Cid.

_ED,"IED.    	Sadly, having spent much of my life in the border areas between southern and Northern Ireland, I am all too familiar with the devastating effects of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).

Of course these days, IEDs are very much in the news in Iraq and Afghanistan."
_TA,"CTA.    	The Chicago ""L"" is the second largest rapid transit system in the US, with the New York City Subway being the largest.

I_IE,"ILIE.    	I think that Ilie Nastase was the most entertaining tennis player of the 1970s, the days of Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe.

'Sepia' is the Latinized version of the Greek word for cuttlefish, as sepia pigment is derived from the ink sac of the cuttlefish.The 'sepia tone' of old photographs is not the result of deterioration over time.

Prints that have been sepia-toned can last in excess of 150 years."

Snagglepuss stole that line from a 1944 movie called, ""Meet the People"" in which it was first uttered by Bert Lahr."
_RIB,"TRIB.    	""The Chicago Tribune"" was first published in 1847.

L_PO,"LIPO.    	Liposuction dates back to the 1920s when it was developed by a surgeon in France. However, the procedure quickly lost favor when a French model developed gangrene after surgery.

The capital city of Freetown was originally set up as a colony to house the ""Black Poor"" of London, England.

Perhaps to help the impoverished souls, perhaps to rid the streets of ""a problem"", three ships were chartered in 1787 to transport a group of blacks, with some whites, to a piece of land purchased in Sierra Leone.

Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to continue his work as a revolutionary. He was captured by Bolivian forces in 1967, and was executed.

The debaters decided to combine three local events to determine the answer, inviting athletes from all three disciplines. The events that were mimicked to come up with the first triathlon were the Waikiki Roughwater swim (2.4 miles), the Around-Oahu Bike Race (115 miles) and the Honolulu Marathon (26.2 miles). The idea was that whoever finished first would be called 'the Iron Man'. The first triathlon was run in 1978, with fifteen starters and only twelve finishers. The race format is used all over the world now, but the Hawaiian Ironman is the event that everyone wants to win."

It was this agreement that largely led to Sadat's assassination three years later.
MS_,"MSU.    	Michigan State University's sports teams used be called the Aggies, as the school was founded as the State Agricultural College of Michigan.

A_WAN,"ASWAN.    	The city of Aswan is one of the driest places on earth, so dry in fact that many locals do not bother putting roofs on all the rooms in their dwellings.

M_H,"MEH.    	Meh!' is one of those terms unfamiliar to me outside of crosswords. It is a modern colloquialism meaning 'I'm not great, but not bad'.

R_TH,"ROTH.    	Eli Roth is one of a group of directors of horror movies known quite graphically as ""The Splat Pack"". I can't stand ""splat"" movies and avoid them as best I can.

The game was introduced into Las Vegas in 1967 by a group of Texan enthusiasts including Doyle Brunson, a champion often seen playing on TV today. Doyle Brunson published a poker strategy guide in 1978, and this really helped increase the popularity of the game. But it was the inclusion of Texas Hold 'Em in the television line-up that really gave the game its explosive surge in popularity, with the size of the prize money just skyrocketing."
_LKS,"ELKS.    	The elk (also known as the wapiti) is the one of the largest species of deer in the world, with only the moose being bigger. Early European settlers were familiar with the smaller red deer back in their homelands, so when they saw the ""huge"" wapiti they assumed it was a moose, and incorrectly gave it the European name for a moose, namely ""elk"". The more correct name for the beast is ""wapiti"", which means ""white rump"" in Shawnee. It's all very confusing ..."

GU_M,"GUAM.    	Guam is a US territory in the western Pacific Ocean, the largest of the Mariana Islands. Guam is also the first territory in the United States to see the sun rise on any particular day. As such, the territory has adopted the motto, 'Where America's day begins'. During WWII, the US territory of Guam was occupied by the Japanese for 31 months until it was liberated in the Battle of Guam in July 1944.

That small temperature change in the Pacific has been associated with climatic changes that can stretch right across the globe.

The phenomenon was given this particular Spanish name because the warming is usually noticed near South America and around Christmas-time."
_OLO,"BOLO.    	I've never worn a bolo tie, and was surprised to discover that it is a relatively recent invention. The first one was apparently produced in Wickenburg, Arizona in the late 1940s by a silversmith. The bolo takes its name from the boleadora, an Argentine lariat."
