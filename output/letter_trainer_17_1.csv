The big controversy surrounding the use of the camel character was that a 1991 study found that 5-6 year old children could recognize Joe Camel more readily than either Mickey Mouse or Fred Flintstone. Also, soon after Old Joe was introduced in the US, the Camel brand's share of the illegal market to underage smokers went up from 1% to just under 33%."

Apparently the scene was meant to be shot twice, with and without the kiss, so that network executives could later decide which version to air.

O_OES,"OBOES.    	The oboe is perhaps my favorite of the reed instruments. The name ""oboe"" comes from the French ""hautbois"" which means ""high wood"". When you hear an orchestra tuning before a performance you'll note (pun intended!) that the oboe starts off the process by playing an ""A"". The rest of the musicians in turn tune to that oboe's ""A"". Oh, and if you want to read a fun book (almost an ""exposé"") about life playing the oboe, you might try ""Mozart in the Jungle"" by oboist Blair Tindall.

D_ANO,"DRANO.    	To clean out drains we might buy Crystal Drano which is sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with sodium nitrate, sodium chloride (table salt) and aluminum. The contents of Drano work in concert to clear the clog. The lye reacts with any fats creating soap which may be enough to break up the clog. Also, the finely-divided aluminum reacts with water creating tremendous heat so that that mixture boils and churns, then any hair or fibers are cut by the sharp edges of the nitrate and chloride crystals. Having said all that, I find that boiling water poured down the drain almost always does the job ..."

With the renaming to Blue Ribbon, the beer was sold with an actual blue ribbon tied around the neck of the bottle until it was dropped in 1916 and incorporated into the label."

S_KE,"SAKE.    	We refer to the Japanese alcoholic beverage made from rice as ""sake"". We've gotten things a bit mixed up in the West.

SCIO_,"SCION.    	Scion comes from the old French word ""sion"" or ""cion"", meaning ""a shoot or a twig"". In botanical terms today, a scion is used in grafting two compatible plants together.

""Fedora"" was a play written for Sarah Bernhardt and first performed in 1889. Bernhardt had the title role of Princess Fedora, and on stage she wore a hat similar to a modern-day fedora.

Men then started wearing fedoras, but only when women gave up the fashion ..."

It took over from the equally successful ""Hill Street Blues"" in the Thursday night 10 p.m. slot until, after a six-year run, it was itself replaced by yet another respected drama, ""E.R."" The opening credits showed that famous California licence plate. The plate was on a Jaguar XJ for most of the series, but moved onto a Bentley towards the end of the run. For each series the registration sticker was updated, so no laws were being broken."

The rest of the musicians in turn tune to that oboe's ""A""."

So, ""high band"" is composed of relatively high frequency values, and ""low band"" of frequencies that are relatively low. FM radio falls into the band called Very High Frequency, or VHF. AM radio uses lower frequencies, and so falls into the relatively low bands of Low, Medium and High Frequency (LF, MF, and HF). Television signals use frequencies even higher than VHF, frequencies in the Ultra High Frequency band (UHF)."
CA_RA,"CAPRA.    	I can't tell you how many of Frank Capra's movies are on my list of all-time favorites. He directed such classics as 'It Happened One Night', 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', 'Lost Horizon', 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', 'Meet John Doe', 'Arsenic and Old Lace' and the holiday favorite 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Capra also did his bit during WWII, enlisting just a few days after Pearl Harbor was attacked. Given his great talent, and the fact that he enlisted at the relatively advanced age of 44, the US Army put him to work directing 11 documentary war films in the 'Why We Fight' series, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal."
GM_C,"GMAC.    	GMAC is short for General Motors Acceptance Corporation. GM has a very small stake in GMAC now, and indeed the name has been officially changed to Ally Bank.

CAI_O,"CAIRO.    	Cairo is the capital city of Egypt. It is the largest city on the continent of Africa and is nicknamed 'The City of a Thousand Minarets' because of its impressive skyline replete with Islamic architecture.

AN_S,"ANAS.    	The Santa Ana winds are the very dry air currents that sweep offshore late in the year in Southern California. Because these air currents are so dry, they are noted for their influence over forest fires in the area, especially in the heat of the fall. The winds arise from a buildup of air pressure in the Great Basin that lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Under the right conditions, that air spills over the peaks of the Sierra Nevada and basically ""falls"" down the side of the Sierra range, heading for the ocean. As the air falls it becomes drier and heats up so that relative humidity can fall to below 10% by the time it hits the coast."
_IT,"KIT.    	The musical ""Cabaret"" is based on ""I Am a Camera"", a 1951 play written by John Van Druten, which itself was adapted from a novel ""Goodbye to Berlin"" written by Christopher Isherwood. ""Cabaret"" is a great musical, although the 1972 film of the musical isn't one of my favorites."

Congress created the Continental Army, and named George Washington as General and Commander-in Chief, having been nominated by John Adams."
_EW,"YEW.    	Voldemort is the main 'bad guy' in the 'Harry Potter' series of books. I heard J. K. Rowling, the author of the books, on the radio the other day and she tells us that 'Voldemort' is supposed to be pronounced with a silent 't' on the end, so it sounds kind of French. But, when the movies came out the actors went with the hard 't', and that's the pronunciation that seems to prevail now."
L_U,"LIU.    	Lucy Liu is an Asian-American actress from Queens, New York. Liu's big break came when she was chosen to play the Ling Woo character in ""Ally McBeal"". I liked her in the 2000 film ""Charlie's Angels"" but as I am no fan of Quentin Tarantino, I did not enjoy the movie ""Kill Bill"". I am having fun watching one of Liu's more recent projects, in which she plays one of the two leads in the TV crime drama 'Elementary'."

It made it to the Old West, where it became a favorite of Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp. The origin of the name ""Faro"" is unclear.

There's another theory involving the usual suspects: Irish immigrants, famines ..."
B_RR,"BARR.    	The comedienne Roseanne Barr is perhaps best known as the star of her own sitcom called 'Roseanne' in which she played the character Roseanne Conner.

I choose to believe that Santa Claus's relics are indeed buried in Ireland ..."

O_ONE,"OZONE.    	Ozone gets its name from the Greek word ozein, meaning ""to smell"". It was given this name as ozone's formation during lightning storms was detected by the gas's distinctive smell. Famously, there is a relatively high concentration of the gas in the 'ozone layer' in the Earth's stratosphere.

A molecule of ozone is made up of three oxygen atoms, whereas a 'normal' oxygen has just two atoms."
EVI_A,"EVITA.    	""Evita"" was the followup musical to ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" for Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.

A_M,"ARM.    	The name 'octopus' comes from the Greek for 'eight-footed'. The most common plural used is 'octopuses', although the Greek plural form 'octopodes' is also quite correct. The plural 'octopi' isn't really correct as the inference is that 'octopus' is like a second-declension Latin noun, which it isn't. That said, dictionaries are now citing 'octopi' as an acceptable plural. Drives me crazy ..."
