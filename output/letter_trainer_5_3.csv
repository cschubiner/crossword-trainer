_EMO,"NEMO.    	""Finding Nemo"" is a 2003 animated blockbuster from Pixar. The film was the winner of the Oscar that year for Best Animated Feature. Believe it or not, ""Finding Nemo"" is the best-selling DVD of all time and, until 2010's ""Toy Story 3"", it was the highest-grossing, G-rated movie at the box office."
_IA,"NIA.    	Not only was the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", she also wrote the screenplay. The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history that didn't make it to number one. That record I think reflects the fact that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came when a spin-off TV show was launched, ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It ran for only 7 episodes."

One ventricle pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs, and the other pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body."
_AM,"SAM.    	The movie ""Casablanca"" was released in January of 1943, timed to coincide with the Casablanca Conference, the high-level meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. The film wasn't a box-office hit, but gained critical acclaim, winning three Oscars including Best Picture. The signature song ""As Time Goes By"" was written many years earlier for a 1931 Broadway musical called ""Everybody's Welcome"", and was a hit in 1931 for Rudy Vallee. But today we all remember the Casablanca version, sung by Dooley Wilson (""Sam"" in the film). Poor Dooley didn't get to record it as a single, due to a musician's strike in 1943, so the 1931 Rudy Vallee version was re-released that year and became an even bigger hit second time round."

T_B,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious, involving lots of tapping on the spacebar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to 'jump' across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key which could be depressed, causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."
_GOR,"IGOR.    	'Prince Igor' is an opera by the Russian composer, Alexander Borodin. Borodin died before he had finished 'Prince Igor', so it was completed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov.

YS_R,"YSER.    	The Yser originates in northern France and flows though Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser name is oft associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of its Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a natural barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful, and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."
H_R,"HER.    	The great musician Stevie Wonder signed up with Motown Records when he was just 11-years-old. He has been remarkably loyal to the label and is still recording with Motown some 50 years later. The level of Stevie Wonder's success is illustrated by his 22 Grammy Awards, the most Grammys awarded to a male solo artist. Wonder was born 6 weeks prematurely, and incomplete development of blood vessels in his eyes caused the retinas to detach leaving him blind soon after birth. He recorded a hit single called 'I Was Made to Love Her' in 1967, and one of his co-writers was his mother, Lula Mae Hardaway."

_EN,"LEN.    	I used to walk my dog right past author Len Deighton's house years ago, as we lived in the same village in Ireland (probably my only claim to fame!). Deighton wrote the excellent espionage thriller ""The IPCRESS File"", made into a 1965 movie starring Michael Caine."
_HE,"SHE.    	Does she...or doesn't she? Only her hairdresser knows for sure"" was the catchphrase for Miss Clairol Hair Color Bath. Clairol had been around since 1931 selling hair coloring products to salons, and then hit the big time with the introduction of a one-step hair coloring product for use at home.

_SER,"YSER.    	The Yser originates in northern France and flows though Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser name is oft associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium, across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of its Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful, and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."

_AB,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious, involving lots of tapping on the space bar and the backspace key. So a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to ""jump"" across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this lever was simplified to a tab key which could be depressed, causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."

I've been sharing here on the blog that the storyline is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader has convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance.

The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended.

N_EL,"NOEL.    	'Noël' is the French word for the Christmas season, ultimately coming from the Latin word for ""birth"" (natalis). Noel has come to be used as an alternative name for a Christmas carol."

EL_A,"ELSA.    	Elsa Schiaparelli was an Italian fashion designer, a great rival of the perhaps more famous Coco Chanel. Schiaparelli was most successful between the two World Wars, but her business closed in 1954, as she failed to adapt to changing tastes after WWII,"
OLI_,"OLIO.    	Olio is a term meaning a hodgepodge or a mixture, coming from the mixed stew of the same name. The stew in turn takes its name from the Spanish ""olla"", the clay pot used when cooking the stew."

_IRE,"EIRE.    	The state symbol of the Irish government is the harp. The reason for the use of the harp as a symbol seems to have been lost in time, but it has been used for centuries. The actual harp used as a model for the state symbol is called the Trinity College harp, a medieval instrument on display in the university in Dublin."
U_E,"UKE.    	Tiny Tim was the stage name of American singer and ukulele player Herbert Khaury. His most famous recording by far was his novelty version of the 1926 song ""Tip-Toe Thru' the Tulips""."
CN_,"CNN.    	Piers Morgan made a name for himself over in the UK as a journalist and then editor of some pretty trashy tabloid newspapers. He had a reputation for being very forceful in investigating the lives of celebrities and is now very much embroiled in the phone-hacking scandals that have rocked British society through 2011. He broke into television in the US as a judge on 'America's Got Talent', and was (surprisingly, I'd say!) chosen to replace Larry King on CNN."
_ER,"HER.    	2003's 'Her' is a rather unusual film. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as a man who develops a relationship with a computer operating system called 'Samantha', which is voiced by Scarlett Johansson."
N_A,"NIA.    	Not only is the delightful Nia Vardalos the star of the 2002 hit movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", she also wrote the screenplay. The film never made it to number one at the box office, but it still pulled in more money than any other movie in history that didn't make it to number one. That record I think reflects the fact that the film wasn't a blockbuster but rather a so-called ""sleeper hit"", a movie that people went to see based on referrals from friends. The big fat mistake came when a spin-off TV show was launched, ""My Big Fat Greek Life"". It ran for only 7 episodes. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2' will hit movie theaters in 2016."
I_RE,"IN RE.    	The term ""in re"" is actually Latin, derived from ""in"" (in) and ""res"" (thing, matter). It literally means ""in the matter"", and is used as ""in regard to"", or ""in the matter of""."

_AM,"SAM.    	The actor Rob Lowe is one of the 'founding members' of the so-called Brat Pack, having appeared in the movie 'St. Elmo's Fire'. More recently, he played a regular character on the TV show 'Parks and Recreation'. My favorite of his roles though, was playing speechwriter Sam Seaborn on Aaron Sorkin's great drama series 'The West Wing'. When 'The West Wing' first aired, Seaborn was billed as the show's main character, but outstanding performances from the rest of the cast and some great writing meant that Lowe's role became 'one of many'. This led to some dissatisfaction on Lowe's part, and eventually he quit the show."

The French ruled Laos as part of French Indochina, having united three separate Lao kingdoms. As there was a plural of ""Lao"" entities united into one, the French added the ""S"" and so today we tend to use ""Laos"" instead of ""Lao""."
AH_B,"AHAB.    	Captain Ahab is the obsessed and far from friendly captain of the Pequod in Herman Melville's ""Moby-Dick"". The role of Captain Ahab was played by Gregory Peck in the 1956 John Huston film adaptation.

I_O,"ITO.    	Judge Lance Ito came in for a lot of criticism for his handling of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The lead prosecutor in that trial was Marcia Clark, you might recall. I read her book ""Without a Doubt"" a few years ago, and she pointed out one trait of Judge Ito that I think is quite telling. Ito would almost always refer to the prosecutor as ""Marcia"", while addressing the men on both sides of the case as ""Mister""."

Y_ER,"YSER.    	The Yser originates in northern France and flows though Belgium into the North Sea. The Yser name is oft associated with WWI as it figured in a major battle early in the conflict. In the first three months of the war, the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium, across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of its Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful, and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."
IT_,"ITO.    	Judge Lance Ito came in for a lot of criticism for his handling of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The lead prosecutor in that trial was Marcia Clark, you might recall. I read the book that's Clark wrote about the trial called ""Without a Doubt"", and she pointed out one trait of Judge Ito that I think is quite telling.

IC_,"ICI.    	Quite a few years ago now, I had the privilege of living just a short car-ride from the beautiful city of Arles in the South of France. Although Arles has a long and colorful history, the Romans had a prevailing influence over the city's design.

T_B,"TAB.    	Like most features on our computer keyboards, the tab key is a hangover from the days of typewriters. When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious, involving lots of tapping on the spacebar and backspace key. So, a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to ""jump"" across the page to positions that could be set by hand. Later this was simplified to a tab key which could be depressed, causing the carriage to jump to the next tab stop in much the same way that the modern tab key works on a computer."

SA_,"SAM.    	Play It Again, Sam' was a Broadway play by Woody Allen that he adapted into a 1972 movie of the same name. The film is a little unusual for Woody Allen in that for once he didn't direct his own work, instead leaving that job to Herbert Ross. 'Play It Again, Sam' is all about a man obsessed by the Humphrey Bogart's role in 'Casablanca'. Something else notable about the Woody Allen film is that the title is actually a misquote from 'Casablanca' as the Ingrid Bergman character actually said, 'Play it once, Sam. For old times' sake'."

_ST,"DST.    	On the other side of the Atlantic, Daylight Saving Time (DST) is known as ""summer time"".

DST was first observed in the US in 1918, and is observed in all states other than Hawaii and Arizona. Hawaii doesn&#8217;t really 'need' DST as the length of daylight doesn&#8217;t vary much due to the state&#8217;s tropical latitude. Arizona&#8217;s climate dictates that extra afternoon daylight is an economic burden due to increased use of air conditioning systems."
LA_A,"LARA.    	Lara Croft was introduced to the world as the main character in a pretty cool video game (I thought, back then) called ""Tomb Raider"", back in 1996.

In the first three months of the war, the German Army pushed almost completely through Belgium, inflicting heavy losses on the Belgian Army as the defenders were forced to fight a fast-moving rearguard action. The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk. The 22-mile long defensive line was chosen at the Yser because the river and canal system could be flooded to create a barrier that might be defended. The plan was successful and the front was ""stabilized"". As we now know, millions of lives were lost over the coming years with very little movement of that battle line."

When using a typewriter, making entries into a table was very tedious as it involved lots of tapping on the space bar and backspace key. So a lever was added to typewriters that allowed the operator to ""jump"" across the page to positions that could be set by hand.

EY_E,"EYRE.    	""Jane Eyre"" is of course the novel written by Charlotte Brontë, under the pen name Currer Bell. Over the years, I've shared here on my blogs that the ""Jane Eyre"" story line is a little too dark and Gothic for my taste, but a very persuasive blog reader convinced me to look more at the romantic side of the story and give it a second chance. I watched a wonderful 4-hour television adaptation of the novel made by the BBC a while back and I have to say that because I was focused on the relationship between Jane and Rochester, I was able to push past the Gothic influences (that depress me) so I really enjoyed the story. I thoroughly recommend the 2006 BBC adaptation to fans of the novel."

The Germans were intent on pushing right through Belgium and across France in a ""race to the sea"". But the Belgians, with the help of their Allies, decided to make a final stand at the Yser Canal in an effort to prevent the Germans reaching the French ports of Calais and Dunkirk.
