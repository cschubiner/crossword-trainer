S_NAR,"SONAR.    	The British developed the first underwater detection system that used sound waves. Research was driven by defence demands during WWI, leading to production of working units in 1922. This new sound detection system was described as using ""supersonics"", but for the purpose of secrecy the term was dropped in favor of an acronym. The work was done under the auspices of the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Division, so ASD was combined with the IC from ""superson-ic-s"" to create the name ASDIC. The navy even went as far as renaming the quartz material at the heart of the technology ""ASDivite"". By the time WWII came along, the Americans were producing their own systems and coined the term SONAR, playing off the related application, RADAR. And so the name ASDIC was deep-sixed ..."

The supposed translation of ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" as ""I am a jelly doughnut"" ... that's just an urban legend. President Kennedy's use of German was perfectly correct."
TONE_,"TONER.    	The key features of a laser printer (or copier) are that it uses plain paper and produces quality text at high speed. Laser printers work by projecting a laser image of the printed page onto a rotating drum that is coated with photoconductors (material that becomes conductive when exposed to light). The areas of the drum exposed to the laser carry a different charge than the unexposed areas. Dry ink (called toner) sticks to the unexposed areas due to electrostatic charge. The toner is then transferred to paper by contact and is fused into the paper by the application of heat. So, that explains why paper coming out of a laser printer is warm, and sometimes powdery ..."

The root of the name ""Oscar"" is hotly debated, but what is agreed is that the award was officially named ""Oscar"" in 1939.

TOS_A,"TOSCA.    	Unlike so many operas, ""Tosca"" was a big hit right from day one, when it was first performed in 1900 as the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. I've only seen it once myself, but it is the eighth most performed opera in America these days."

AN_,"-ANE.    	The 'smaller' alkanes are gases, and are quite combustible. Methane (CH4) is the main component of natural gas, with ethane (C2H6) being the second largest component. Propane (C3H8) is also found in natural gas and is heavy enough to be readily turned into a liquid by compression, for ease of transportation and storage.

IV_N,"IVAN.    	The Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan IV became known as Ivan the Terrible. The name ""terrible"" is a translation from Russian, and perhaps creates the wrong impression about the man.

_RESTU,"ERES TU.    	We have a big event across Europe every year called the Eurovision Song Contest. Each nation enters one song in competition with each other, and then voters across the whole continent decide on the winner. That's how ABBA got their big break, when the group won in 1974 with ""Waterloo"". In 1972, Spain's entry was ""Eres tu"" sung by the band Mocedades. ""Eres tu"" is the Spanish for ""you are"". It came second in the competition but should have won, in my humble opinion."
_NIX,"UNIX.    	I always think of an operating system as that piece of software that sits between the hardware on my computer and the programs that I choose to run. Developers of application programs don't really have to worry about being able to ""talk to"" the countless different types of hardware that can exist on a computer, they just need to talk to the handful of operating systems that are out there, like Windows, MAC and Unix. The operating system takes care of the rest."
_INC,"ZINC.    	A battery is a device that converts chemical energy into electric energy. A simple battery is made up of three parts: a cathode, an anode and a liquid electrolyte. Ions from the electrolyte react chemically with the material in the anode producing a compound and releasing electrons. At the same time, the electrolyte reacts with the material in the cathode, absorbing electrons and producing a different chemical compound. In this way, there is a buildup of electrons at the anode and a deficit of electrons at the cathode. When a connection (wire, say) is made between the cathode and anode, electrons flow through the resulting circuit from the anode to cathode in an attempt to rectify the electron imbalance."

In 1980, a daredevil took it upon himself to parachute onto the top of the arch intending to further jump from the apex of the arch and parachute to the ground.

There aren&#8217;t many advertising agencies left on Madison Avenue these days though, as most have moved to other parts of New York City. The street takes its name from Madison Square, which is bounded on one side by Madison Avenue. The square in turn takes its name from James Madison, the fourth President of the United States."

STP_T,"ST PAT.    	There is a fair amount known about St. Patrick, some of which comes from two letters written in his own hand. St. Patrick lived in the fifth century, but was not born in Ireland. He was first brought to Ireland at about 16 years of age from his native Britain, by Irish raiders who made him a slave for six years. Patrick managed to escape and returned to his homeland where he studied and entered the Church. He went back to Ireland as a bishop and a missionary and there lived out the rest of his life. There seems to be good evidence that he died on March 17th (now celebrated annually as St. Patrick's Day), although the year is less clear. The stories about shamrock and snakes, I am afraid they are the stuff of legend."

MA_S,"MARS.    	Having lived on both sides of the Atlantic, I find the Mars Bar to be the most perplexing of candies! The original Mars Bar is a British confection (and delicious) first manufactured in 1932. The US version of the original Mars Bar is called a Milky Way. But there is candy bar called a Milky Way that is also produced in the UK, and it is completely different to its US cousin, and is more like an American ""3 Musketeers"". And then there is an American confection called a Mars Bar, something different again. No wonder I gave up eating candy bars ..."

This new sound detection system was described as using ""supersonics"", but for the purpose of secrecy the term was dropped in favor of an acronym. The work was done under the auspices of the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Division, so ASD was combined with the IC from ""superson-ic-s"" to create the name ASDIC. The navy even went as far as renaming the quartz material at the heart of the technology ""ASDivite"". By the time WWII came along, the Americans were producing their own systems and coined the term SONAR, playing off the related application, RADAR. And so the name ASDIC was deep-sixed ..."

The river in turn takes its name from the French ""Riviere des Moines"" meaning ""River of the Monks"". It looks like there isn't any ""monkish"" connection to the city's name per se. ""Des Moines"" was just the name given by French traders who corrupted ""Moingona"", the name of a group of Illinois Native Americans who lived by the river. However, others do contend that French Trappist monks, who lived a full 200 miles from the river, somehow influenced the name."

After divorcing Shaw she married restaurateur Joseph Crane, but had the marriage annulled when she found out that Crane was still married to his first wife.

When Cheryl was 14-years-old, her mother was romantically involved with a shady character named Johnny Stompanato. One evening Cheryl found her mother engaged in a violent argument with Stompanato, and Cheryl became so scared that she pulled out a gun and killed him in what was deemed to be justifiable homicide.

""Eres tu"" is the Spanish for ""you are"". It is a great song, that came in second but should have won, in my humble opinion."
ING_,"INGA.    	I am not really a big fan of movies by Mel Brooks, but 'Young Frankenstein' is the exception. I think the cast has a lot to do with me liking the film, as it includes Gene Wilder (Dr. Frankenstein), Teri Garr (Inga), Marty Feldman (Igor) and Gene Hackman (Harold, the blind man)."

HO_O,"HOBO.    	No one seems to know for sure how the term ""hobo"" originated, although there are lots of colorful theories. My favorite is that ""hobo"" comes from the first letters in the words ""ho-meward bo-und"", but it doesn't seem very plausible. A kind blog reader tells me that according to Click and Clack from PBS's ""Car Talk"" (a great source!), ""hobo"" comes from ""hoe boy"". Hoe boys were young men with hoes looking for work after the Civil War. Hobos differed from ""tramps"" and ""bums"", in that ""bums"" refused to work, ""tramps"" worked when they had to, while ""hobos"" traveled in search of work."

The original alcoholic version actually contained a small concentration of cocaine."

The musical is set in New York City and features two rival gangs: the Sharks from Puerto Rico and the Jets with working-class, Caucasian roots.

LEIC_,"LEICA.    	Leica is a German optics company, famous for production of lenses and cameras. The 1913 Leica was the first practical camera that could use 35mm film, a size chosen because it was already the standard for film used in motion pictures."

These two ingredients inspired the brand name we use today: Pepsi-Cola."

ATOL_,"ATOLL.    	The origin of the name ""bikini"", a type of bathing suit, seems very uncertain. My favorite story is that it is named after the Bikini Atoll, site of American A-bomb tests in the forties and fifties. The name ""bikini"" was chosen for the swim-wear because of the ""explosive"" effect it had on men who saw a woman wearing the garment!"

I say that something produced in a test tube shouldn't be in our food ..."

_OTEM,"TOTEM.    	Totem is the name given to any entity that watches over a group of people. As such, totems are usually the subjects of worship. Totem poles are really misnamed, as they are not intended to represent figures to be worshiped, but rather are heraldic in nature often celebrating the legends or notable events in the history of a tribe."
ASPC_,"ASPCA.    	Unlike in other countries, there is no ""umbrella"" society in the US with the goal of preventing cruelty to animals. Instead there are independent organizations set up all over the nation using the name SPCA. Having said that, there is an American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) that was originally intended to operate across the country, but really it focuses its efforts in New York City."
R_DS,"RADS.    	Dosimeters measure exposure to something in the environment, with radiation exposure the most recognized.

A_S,"ADS.    	You'll see a few ""Ads by Google"" around the edges of this blog. They help to cover the costs of publication. Google collects ""ad space"" from site owners like me, and then sells that space to advertisers. When someone clicks on an ad, Google collects a small fee from the advertiser (usually fractions of a penny). Whatever is collected, Google splits with the site owner. At fractions of a penny per click, I won't be getting too rich from the scheme ..."
D_D,"DAD.    	Father's Day was added as an official holiday in 1972, although bills to create the holiday had been with Congress since 1913.

P_ANO,"PIANO.    	The Baldwin Piano Company was founded in 1857 by Dwight Hamilton Baldwin from Cincinnati, Ohio.

T_TEM,"TOTEM.    	Totem is the name given to any entity that watches over a group of people. As such, totems are usually the subjects of worship. Totem poles are really misnamed, as they are not intended to represent figures to be worshiped, but rather are heraldic in nature, often celebrating the legends or notable events in the history of a tribe."

_IEU,"LIEU.    	As you might imagine, ""in lieu"" comes into English from the Old French word ""lieu"" meaning ""place"", which in turn is derived from the Latin ""locum"", also meaning ""place"". So, ""in lieu"" means ""in place of""."
A_DEN,"ARDEN.    	The Forest of Arden is the setting for Shakespeare's ""As You Like It"". Even though there is a Forest of Arden surrounding Shakespeare's home town of Stratford-on-Avon, seeing as the play is set in France one has to assume that the ""As You Like It"" Arden is an Anglicization of the forested ""Ardennes"" region that stretches from Belgium into France,and that famously featured in WWII's Battle of the Bulge."
_NGA,"INGA.    	The lovely Teri Garr had a whole host of minor roles in her youth, including appearances in nine Elvis movies.

You'll see dovetail joints in drawers around the house."

His father was Mayor of Santiago and served in the Cuban House of Representatives. However, the family had to flee to Miami after the 1933 revolution led by Batista."
U_IX,"UNIX.    	I always think of an operating system as that piece of software that sits between the hardware on my computer and the programs that I choose to run. Developers of application programs don't really have to worry about being able to ""talk to"" the countless different types of hardware found in the wide variety of computers that are manufactured, they just need to talk to the handful of operating systems that are out there, like Windows, MAC and Unix. The operating system takes care of the rest."
_ARI,"BARI.    	Bari is a port city in Italy, on the Adriatic coast. The city is noted for being the only location in WWII to experience chemical warfare, although it was unintended. Mustard gas was released when a US Liberty ship was attacked by German bombers. The Allied leaders ordered that the incident be kept secret, and it wasn't until 1967 that the story was widely reported. Most of the fatalities from the gas were American seamen."
F_D,"FTD.    	Back in 1910, fifteen florists from around America agreed to fulfill each other's orders using the telegraph system, setting up what they called the Florists' Telegraph Delivery.

C_ARA,"CLARA.    	If you ever get the chance to see it, I highly recommend the movie 1947 ""Song of Love"", a biopic about the lives of Robert Schumann and his extraordinary wife, Clara Wieck. Schumann is played by Paul Henreid (of ""Casablanca"" fame) and Clara is played wonderfully by Katherine Hepburn. Clara was a concert pianist, and as Katherine Hepburn was an accomplished pianist herself, you see Hepburn actually playing some challenging pieces herself at the keyboard (although the soundtrack does feature a professional player)."
C_U,"CPU.    	The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the main component on the ""motherboard"" of a computer. The CPU is the part of the computer that carries out most of the functions required by a program. Nowadays you can get CPUs in everything from cars to telephones."

The derivative ""snooty"", an adjective to describe a ""high-hat"", someone very haughty, started out as ""snouty"" back in the 1850s. The idea is that someone who is snooty, or snouty, tends to look down his or her nose at the rest of the world."
AME_A,"AMEBA.    	An ameba (or ""amoeba"", as we spell it back in Ireland) is a single-celled microorganism. The name comes from the Greek ""amoibe"", meaning change. The name is quite apt, as the cell changes shape readily as the ameba moves, eats and reproduces."
AS_,"AS A.    	Our phrase 'happy as a clam' dates back to the mid-1600s. Back then it was a more lengthy expression: 'happy as a clam in the mud at high tide'. The idea was that a clam would be happy in its muddy home at high tide, because no one from land could get to it and eat it."
_ARS,"MARS.    	Sir Arthur C. Clarke was a British science-fiction writer, perhaps most famous for his novel '2001: A Space Odyssey'."
E_HEL,"ETHEL.    	""On Golden Pond"" was originally a play, written by Ernest Thompson.

There was also a television adaptation of the play released in 2001, with another distinguished cast that included Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as the leads."
_LSEN,"OLSEN.    	I know very little about the Olsen twins, but I am told that folks believe Mary-Kate and Ashley to be identical twins. They look very much alike, but are in fact fraternal twins. The sisters were cast as Michelle Tanner on the eighties sitcom 'Full House', taking turns playing the role."
ANSE_,"ANSEL.    	As an avid amateur photographer, I have been a big fan of the work of Ansel Adams for many years and must have read all of his books. Adams was famous for clarity and depth in his black and white images. Central to his technique was the use of the zone system, his own invention. The zone system is a way of controlling exposure in an image, particularly when there is a high contrast in the subject. Although the technique was developed primarily for black & white film, it can even apply to digital color images. In the digital world, the main technique is to expose an image for the highlights, and one or more images for the shadows. These images can then be combined digitally giving a final photograph with a full and satisfying range of exposures."
_OUE,"ROUE.    	""Roue"" is a lovely word, I think, describing a less than lovely man. A roue could otherwise be described as a cad, someone of loose morals. ""Roue"" comes from the French word ""rouer"" meaning ""to break on a wheel"". This describes the ancient form of capital punishment where a poor soul was lashed to a wheel and then beaten to death with cudgels and bars. I guess the suggestion is that a roue, with his loose morals, deserves such a punishment."
AG_TE,"AGATE.    	In the world of typography, 'agate' is a unit of measure. One agate is is equal to 5.5 points, or about one quarter of an inch. Agate is generally the smallest type size used in newspapers, and is generally restricted to advertisements and market reports in financial publications."
_OY,"SOY.    	I drink a lot of soy milk, and love the stuff. I recently discovered rice milk though, and prefer that for drinking. Check them out ... save a cow ..."
AM_BA,"AMEBA.    	An ameba (or ""amoeba"" as we spell it back in Ireland) is a single-celled microorganism. The name comes from the Greek ""amoibe"", meaning change. The name is quite apt, as the cell changes shape readily as the ameba moves, eats and reproduces."
_DITH,"EDITH.    	Edith Wilson was the second wife of President Woodrow Wilson. There is little doubt that Mrs. Wilson acted as Chief of Staff for her husband, and some say actually ran the country, for some time after he suffered a stroke in 1919. She strongly opposed the notion that Vice President Riley Marshall should assume the powers of president, and so stepped in herself. Mrs Wilson retired with her husband in 1921 when he left office, and she nursed him until his death in 1924. Edith Wilson is sometimes referred to as the ""first female president of the US"". Since 1965, the issue no longer exists, as the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution was enacted, providing direction on procedure should the President become incapacitated."
M_E,"MRE.    	The Meal, Ready-to-Eat comes in a lightweight package, easier to tote around. It replaced the more cumbersome Meal, Combat, Individual (MCI) in 1981, a meal in a can."
_IG,"AIG.    	AIG is the American International Group, a giant insurance corporation (or I should say, ""was""). After repeated bailouts by American taxpayers, the company made some serious PR blunders by spending large amounts of money on executive entertainment and middle management rewards. These included a $444,000 California retreat, an $86,000 hunting trip in England, and a $343,000 getaway to a luxury resort in Phoenix. Poor judgment, I'd say ..."
ERN_,"ERNO.    	What was originally called the 'Magic Cube' became better known as Rubik's Cube, named for its inventor Ern≈ë Rubik. Rubik's Cube is the world's biggest selling puzzle game, with over 350 million sold in just over 30 years."
D_NO,DINO.    	Sinclair Oil has been around a long time as the company was founded back in 1916 by Harry F. Sinclair. Sinclair sponsored an exhibit at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933-34 that focused on the Age of the Dinosaurs and the era's relationship with the formation of petroleum products. The exhibit included a huge model of a brontosaurus that was a big hit with the fair's attendees. Sinclair cashed in on the popularity of the dinosaur theme by selling rubber dinosaur toys at gas stations and eventually adopted the brontosaurus as part of the company logo.
N_OBE,"NIOBE.    	In Greek mythology, when her children were killed, Niobe fled to Mt. Sipylus where she was turned into stone and wept for eternity. There is in fact a Niobe's Rock on Mt. Sipylus that resembles a female face, and so is known as ""The Weeping Rock""."
A_T,"AIT.    	Aits are little islands found in a river. Aits aren't formed by erosion, but by the deposition of silt over time. As a result, aits often have a long and narrow shape running parallel to the banks as the sediment builds up with the flow of the water. Many of the islands in the River Thames in England have been given the name Ait, like Raven's Ait in Kingston-upon-Thames, and Lot's Ait in Brentford."
TO_,"TOD.    	Tod Browning was an actor, director and screenwriter noted for his collaborations with Lon Chaney. His most famous work as a director is ""Dracula"" from 1931, starring B√©la Lugosi in the title role."
NI_LA,"NILLA.    	As one might expect, Nilla is a shortened from of ""vanilla"". However, you won't find any vanilla in Nilla cookies or wafers. They have always been flavored with vanillin, synthetic vanilla. Is nothing sacred ...?"
KER_,"KERR.    	The lovely Deborah Kerr was a Scottish actress who made a real name for herself on the American stage and in Hollywood movies. Despite all her success, and six nominations for a Best Actress Oscar, Kerr never actually won an Academy Award. In 1967 she appeared in the James Bond film ""Casino Royale"" at the age of 46, making her oldest Bond Girl of all time."
_OSE,"NOSE.    	In Greek mythology, the creature known as the Sphinx has the body of a lion, the wings of a bird and the face of a woman. The Sphinx threatened to strangle and devour any person who could not answer a famous riddle: 'Which creature walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs in the evening?' Oedipus was able to save himself by answering correctly 'Man'. The idea is that a man crawls on all fours as a baby, and then walks on two feet as an adult, and walks with a cane in old age. 'Sphinx' is actually a Greek word, meaning 'the strangler' ..."
STET_,"STETS.    	""Stet"" is a Latin word meaning ""let it stand"". In editorial work, the typesetter is instructed to disregard any change previously marked by writing the word ""stet"" and then underscoring that change with a line of dots or dashes."
_ISC,"DISC.    	The first standard set for rotational speed of gramophone records was 78 rpm, but like so many things it seems, the US version of ""78"" was slightly different from that for the rest of the world. The US record was designed to play at 78.26 rpm, whereas the standard in the rest of the world was 77.92 rpm. So, imported records playing on American equipment didn't sound quite as they were intended."
_EL,BEL.    	Un bel di' is the most famous aria from Puccini's opera 'Madama Butterfly'. It is also one of the most beautiful arias in the whole soprano repertoire. 'Un bel di' translates as 'One beautiful day'.
_OD,TOD.    	'Tod' is the German word for 'death'.
EAGL_,"EAGLE.    	We always seem to remember the phrase ""The Eagle has landed"", historic words spoken by Neil Armstrong when he put down Apollo 11's Lunar Excursion Module on the surface of the moon. Looking back I have to say that the words preceding ""The Eagle has landed"" seem to have even more impact. During the descent to the moon's surface Armstrong used the call sign ""Eagle"", indicating that he was communicating from the LEM. After he killed the engines on touching down, Armstrong's first words home to Earth were ""Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."" That switch of call sign from ""Eagle"" to ""Tranquility Base"" always sends shivers down my spine ..."
_BE,"OBE.    	The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire is an order of chivalry in the UK that was established in 1917 by King George V. There are five classes within the order, which are in descending seniority:"
_RLY,"ORLY.    	Paris-Orly Airport is Paris's second international airport (after Charles de Gaulle), and Paris Beauvais-Till√© is used by the budget airlines, as it is a 75 minute coach ride to the city center."
CLAR_,"CLARA.    	Santa Clara University is a private, Jesuit school in Santa Clara, California. The first of its colleges was founded in 1851, making it the oldest higher education institute in the whole state."
TUT_,"TUTU.    	The word ""tutu"", used for a ballet dancer's skirt, is actually a somewhat ""naughty"" term. It came into English from French in the early 20th century. The French ""tutu"" is an alteration of the word ""cucu"", a childish word for ""cul"" meaning the ""bottom,"" or ""backside""."
_VAN,IVAN.    	Ivan Turgenev was a Russian novelist and playwright. Turgenev's most famous works are a collection of short stories called 'A Sportsman's Sketches' (1852) and the novel 'Fathers and Sons' (1862).
O_EN,"OXEN.    	""Draft"" can mean a load, something that is pulled or drawn. Horses or perhaps oxen that are used to pull loads are called ""draft animals""."
SAR_H,"SARAH.    	The Sarah Siddons Award is presented annually to an actor for outstanding performance in Chicago theater. The name of the award was inspired by a reference in the 1950 movie 'All About Eve' which references a fictional 'Sarah Siddons Award'. That said, the fictional award was named for a real actress. Sarah Siddons was a stage actress from Wales."
NI_LA,"NILLA.    	As one might expect, Nilla is a shortened from of ""vanilla"". However, you won't find any vanilla in Nilla cookies or wafers. They always been flavored with vanillin, synthetic vanilla. Is nothing sacred ...?"
RA_A,"RATA.    	""Pro rata"" is a Latin phrase meaning ""in proportion""."
MINS_,"MINSK.    	Minsk is the capital of Belarus, formerly known as the Belorussion Soviet Socialist Republic."
TRY_T,"TRYST.    	In its most general sense, a tryst is a meeting at an agreed time and place. More usually we consider a tryst to be a prearranged meeting between lovers. The term comes from the Old French 'triste', a waiting place designated when hunting."
G_S,"GAS.    	The halogens are a group of elements in the periodic table consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and astatine. The term 'halogen' was the name that was originally proposed for chlorine when it was first discovered. When it was passed over in favor of chlorine, the name 'halogen' was given to the group of elements to which chlorine belonged."
_AC,"PAC.    	Pac-12 is an abbreviation for the Pacific-12 Conference, a college athletic conference in the western US. The Pac-12 has won more NCAA National Team Championships than any other conference. The Pac-12 was founded in 1915 as the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). Over time as it grew, the conference went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, Pacific-10 and became the Pacific-12 in 2011."
N_RY,"NARY.    	The adjective ""nary"" means ""not one"", as in 'nary a soul'."
_ENA,"NENA.    	Nena is a German singer (""Nena"" became the name of her band as well) who had a big hit with one of my favorite songs of the eighties ""99 Luftballons"". The English translation of the German title (""99 Red Balloons"") isn't literal, with the color ""red"" added just so that the title had the right number of syllables for the tune. ""Luftballon"" is the name given to a child's toy balloon in German."
PIN_A,"PINTA.    	As we all know, Christopher Columbus used three ships in his first voyage across the Atlantic: the Santa Maria, the Ni√±a and the Pinta. The Pinta was the fastest of the three, and it was from the Pinta that the New World was first spotted, by a sailor called Rodrigo de Triana who was a lookout on the fateful day. Pinta was a nickname for the ship that translated as ""the painted one"". The Pinta's real name has been lost in mists of time."

I_BN,"ISBN.    	The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) was invented by one Gordon foster, who now is a professor at Trinity College, Dublin in Ireland. The code was originally developed for booksellers, so that they had a unique number (and now a bar code) for each publication."
_RDEN,"ARDEN.    	The Forest of Arden is the setting for Shakespeare's ""As You Like It"". Even though there is a Forest of Arden surrounding Shakespeare's home town of Stratford-on-Avon, seeing as the play is set in France, one has to assume that the ""As You Like It"" Arden is an Anglicization of the forested ""Ardennes"" region that stretches from Belgium into France."
MONE_,"MONET.    	Claude Monet painted the harbor of Le Havre in the north of France in 1872, giving it the title ""Impression, Sunrise"". The painting is not a ""realistic"" representation of the scene in front of him, hence the name ""impression"". It was this very painting that gave rise to the name of the Impressionist movement, and earned Monet the title of Father of Impressionism."
ST_IN,"STEIN.    	Oktoberfest is a 16-day beer festival in Munich that actually starts in September. About six million people attend every year, making it the largest fair in the world. I've been there twice, and it really is a great party ..."
M_N,"MEN.    	Sandra Day O'Connor is a former Associate justice on the US Supreme Court. O'Connor was the first woman appointed to the court, and was in office from 1981 after being appointed by President Reagan. As the court became more conservative she was viewed as the swing vote in many decisions. As a result, O'Connor was known as one of the most powerful women in the world. She retired in 2006 (replaced by Samuel Alito), and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2009."
_AINE,"MAINE.    	As well as being the easternmost US state capital, Augusta, Maine is the third smallest, with a population of under 20,000."
USA_R,"USAIR.    	From 1953, what today is US Airways was called Allegheny Airlines. In the seventies, customers became very dissatisfied with the company's service levels as it struggled to manage a rapid expansion in its number of flights. These problems earned the airline the nickname 'Agony Air'. Allegheny tried to leave the 'agony' behind in 1979 and changed its name to USAir. In 1997, the name was again changed, to US Airways."
_EO,"DEO.    	""Gloria in excelsis Deo"" is a Latin hymn, the title of which translates as ""Glory to God in the highest""."

I_I,"III.    	In the fun 1985 movie 'Back to the Future', Marty McFly finds himself back in 1955, and is trying to get back to HIS future, which is 1985. But on the other hand, 1985 is really Marty's present, before he went back in time. Why does time travel have to be so complicated ...?"
TO_ER,"TONER.    	The key features of a laser printer (or copier) are that it uses plain paper and produces quality text at high speed. Laser printers work by projecting a laser image of the printed page onto a rotating drum that is coated with photoconductors (material that becomes conductive when exposed to light). The areas of the drum exposed to the laser carry a different charge than the unexposed areas. Dry ink (called toner) sticks to the unexposed areas due to electrostatic charge. The toner is then transferred to paper by contact and is fused into the paper by the application of heat. So, that explains why paper coming out of a laser printer is warm, and sometimes powdery ..."
O_TS,"OATS.    	Traditionally, wild oats was a crop that one would regret sowing instead of 'good grain'. Young and tempestuous people were rash enough to sow their wild oats, and had yet to comprehend their folly. Over time, to 'feel one's oats' came to mean 'be lively and confident'."
_INC,"ZINC.    	Zinc is the chemical element with the atomic number 30 and the element symbol 'Zn'. Zinc is a metal that can form pointed crystals after smelting. It is probably these crystals that gave the element its name, which comes from the Old High German 'zint' meaning 'point'."

SLA_,"SLAG.    	The better lead ores are processed in a blast furnace, to extract the metal. The ""waste"" from this process is called ""slag"". Slag does contain some lead and it can be processed further in a ""slag furnace"" to extract the residual metal. Slag furnaces also accept poorer lead ores as a raw material."
EC_,"ECU.    	The ecu was an Old French coin, and when introduced in 1640, was worth three livres (an older coin, called a ""pound"" in English). The word ""ecu"" comes from the Latin ""scutum"" meaning ""shield"". The original ecu used to have a coat of arms on it, a shield."

S_OIC,"STOIC.    	Zeno of Citium was a Greek philosopher famous for teaching at the Stoa Poikile, the ""Painted Porch"", located on the north side of the Ancient Agora of Athens. Because of the location of his classes, his philosophy became known as stoicism (from ""stoa"", the word for ""porch""). And yes, we get our adjective ""stoic"" from the same root."
T_SE,"TASE.    	Victor Appleton wrote a novel for young adults called ""Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle"". The company that developed the TASER electroshock weapon, named their product as a homage to the novel. TASER stands for Thomas A. Swift's Electric Rifle. Interesting, eh?"

The monument has a prominent role to play in Dan Brown's latest book ""The Lost Symbol"", which I read not too long ago (not as good as ""Angels & Demons""). Before the Washington Monument was finished in 1885, Cologne Cathedral was the world's tallest structure.

_CH,"ICH.    	""Ich"" is the German for ""I"", as in ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" (I am a Berliner), the famous words of support uttered by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 in a speech in West Berlin. The supposed translation of ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" as ""I am a jelly doughnut"" ... that's just an urban legend. President Kennedy's use of German was perfectly correct."
IM_O,"IMHO.    	If you're in an online chat room, watch out for ""In My Humble Opinion"" ..."
_ATER,"OATER.    	""Wyoming Outlaw"" is a 1939 western movie starring John Wayne.

The current lion is called Leo, and he has been around since 1957."

ROU_,"ROUE.    	""Roue"" is a lovely word, I think, describing a less than lovely man. A roue could otherwise be described as a cad, someone of loose morals. ""Roue"" comes from the French word ""rouer"" meaning ""to break on a wheel"". This describes the ancient form of capital punishment where a poor soul was lashed to a wheel and then beaten to death with cudgels and bars. I guess the suggestion is that a roue, with his loose morals, deserves such a punishment."

GM_,"GMC.    	The term SUV, Sports Utility Vehicle was introduced by our marketing friends. Using the term Sports Utility Vehicle was a very clever way to get us to pay a lot of money for what was essentially a station wagon on a truck chassis, at least it was back then."

So it fell to Charlemagne to defend and extend the borders of the empire, and because of this it is Charlemagne that we read about today, not Carloman I. It was Emperor Charlemagne who in effect founded the Holy Roman Empire."

YM_,YMA.    	Yma Sumac was a Peruvian soprano. Sumac had a notable vocal range of five octaves.
C_EN,"COEN.    	I think it's great to see two brothers working together and being so successful. Joel and Ethan Coen are two movie producers and directors who both live in New York City.

TOT_M,"TOTEM.    	Totem is the name given to any entity that watches over a group of people, such as a tribe. As such, totems are usually the subjects of worship.

The heavier alkanes are liquids and solids at room temperature."

L_G,"LOG.    	As an example, the number 10,000 is equal to 10 to the power of 4, so the base-10 logarithm of 10,000 is said to be 4. Inversely, the antilogarithm of 4 (in the base-10) is 10,000. But, we all remember that from school, don't we?"

UNI_,"UNIX.    	I always think of an operating system as that piece of software that sits between the hardware on my computer and the programs that I choose to run. Developers of application programs don't really have to worry about being able to ""talk to"" the countless different types of hardware found in the wide variety of computers that are manufactured, they just need to talk to the handful of operating systems that are out there, like Windows, MAC and Unix. The operating system takes care of the rest."
_TOIC,"STOIC.    	Zeno of Citium was a Greek philosopher famous for teaching at the Stoa Poikile, the ""Painted Porch"", located on the north side of the Ancient Agora of Athens.
